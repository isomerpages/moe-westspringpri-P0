<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will in-house certificate be accepted for the programme?</strong>
</p>
<p>SwimSafer 2.0 Programme only accepts certificates <strong>issued by ActiveSG</strong> for
your child/ ward to progress to the next stage as they have a standardised
testing assessment criteria. An external assessor will be engaged to assess
your child/ ward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can submit in-house certificates (other than ActiveSG) but the schoolâ€™s
contracted coaches will do a short assessment of your child/ ward on the
first lesson and recommend a proficiency stage that matches his/ her abilities.
This will enable your child to complete the stage successfully with certification
at the end of the programme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below are examples of in-house certificates.</p>
