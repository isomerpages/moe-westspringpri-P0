<h4><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will in-house certificate be accepted for the programme?</strong></h4>
<p>SwimSafer 2.0 Programme only accepts certificates <strong>issued by ActiveSG</strong> for
your child/ ward to progress to the next stage as they have a standardised
testing assessment criteria. An external assessor will be engaged to assess
your child/ ward.</p>
<p>You can submit in-house certificates (other than ActiveSG) but the school’s
contracted coaches will do a short assessment of your child/ ward on the
first lesson and recommend a proficiency stage that matches his/ her abilities.
This will enable your child to complete the stage successfully with certification
at the end of the programme.</p>
<p>Below are examples of in-house certificates.</p>

<h4><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is the SwimSafer 2.0 programme certification important?</strong></h4>
<p>This programme is offered under ActiveSG and is a comprehensive initiative
as a national programme. The certificate issued by them are officially
recognized by all schools, institutions and water-related sports (e.g.
Kayaking, Scuba diving) in Singapore. Therefore, with the authentic certification,
your child/ ward can pursue further on water-related programmes conducted
in schools or pursue interest in water-related activities at his/ her own
pace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What if my child/ ward can swim but not certified?</strong></h4>
<p>Students who can swim but not certified will be placed under <strong>STAGE 1</strong> proficiency
level.</p>
<p>If the child/ ward is currently learning swimming, parent/ guardian may
wish to seek the advice of own private swimming coach on the placement
of the child's/ ward’s swim test stage. Please email your child’s/ ward’s
PE teacher on the stage placement.</p>
<p>If child/ ward does not have any proper swimming lessons or had lessons
but stopped for a period of time (more than 6 months), we would recommend
that the child/ ward remains to be tested for STAGE 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How will it affect if my child/ ward can swim without certification and I want to skip STAGE 1?</strong></h4>
<p>Your child/ ward might end up not having any certifications if the child/
ward unfortunately fails the requested stage test.</p>
<p><strong><em>Example:</em></strong><em> Your child/ ward has no certification and you request for STAGE 2 instead of STAGE 1. If child/ ward fails STAGE 2 practical test, he/ she will not be awarded any certification even though he/ she passes the Theory Quiz. This applies to all other stages.</em>
</p>

<h4><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My child/ ward has private swimming lessons. What if my child/ ward has an updated SwimSafer 2.0 certification (under ActiveSG) after submitting the declaration online?</strong></h4>
<p>We will allow the change as long as it is <strong>before Session 3, </strong>prior
to the school registering your child/ ward with SportsSG. &nbsp;Please
submit the updated SwimSafer 2.0 certificate via email or hardcopy to his/
her PE teacher.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How will students be grouped for the programme?</strong></h4>
<p>Students will be grouped based on swimming ability with a safety ratio
of 1 coach: 10 students. Should the number of students for a specific stage
be too small to form a group, students of mixed swimming ability may form
a group.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happens if my child/ ward is absent on the day of Practical Assessment (Session 8)? Will there be any make-up session?</strong></h4>
<p>There will not be any make-up Practical Assessment for individual student
who miss the test date as the school will be engaging external assessors
for the Practical Assessment only on Session 8.</p>
<p>Make-up session will not apply as well for your child’s/ ward’s absence
in other swimming sessions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can child/ ward who missed the Practical Assessment be certified?</strong></h4>
<p>Parents/ Guardians may refer to <a href="https://swimsafer.com.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://swimsafer.com.sg/</a> for more
details on external Practical Assessment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the school’s contracted vendor do external testing for my child/ ward if he/ she missed the Practical Assessment?</strong></h4>
<p>The school’s contracted vendor is not allowed to conduct Practical Assessment
due to conflict of interest. Only ActiveSG certified assessors, who are
engaged externally by the school, can conduct the assessment.</p>
