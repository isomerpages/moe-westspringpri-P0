<p>We are thrilled to announce our <strong>2025 Alumni Day</strong>, bringing
together former students who graduated from West Spring Primary for a heartwarming
reunion on 3 September 2025.</p>
<p>This year’s theme, <strong>“Rewind &amp; Reconnect: You’re Always Part of Us,”</strong> captures
the spirit of belonging and lasting connection. As alumni return to familiar
grounds, we invite you to take a walk down memory lane and look back on
the memorable moments and relationships forged during your formative school
years in West Spring Primary School.&nbsp; Take this chance to reconnect
not only with friends and teachers, but also with the values and community
that shaped you.</p>
<p>Interested WSPS Alumni should register their interest via the following
link. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/wspsalumni2025</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that the school <u>will not</u> be open for Alumni to visit
during Teachers’ Day on 4 September as teachers will be engaged in Teachers’
Day activities. We look forward to welcoming you back to West Spring on
3 September!</p>
