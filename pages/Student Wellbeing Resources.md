As part of our school’s ongoing effort in partnering our parents/guardians in the holistic development of our students, we have prepared a series of videos centred around our students’ well-being.

These videos aim to create awareness and an understanding of the strategies and terminologies that the school is using. We also hope to impart these strategies and skills to the students as they continue to develop over the years.

#### Introduction

Everyone has feelings. It is natural to feel many different emotions as things happen throughout our day.  However, from time to time, we may find it difficult to manage strong feelings such as anger, anxiousness, or fear- and this stops us from getting on with our day effectively. Such extreme emotions can get out of control, and we need to find ways to get back to calmness.

Recognizing our emotions accurately can help us be clear of what is happening inside, so that we can manage ourselves in positive ways and become better learners. Check out the videos to learn how our feelings can be sorted and what we can do to help us cope with difficult emotions.

#### Zones of Regulation

The Zones of Regulation aims to teach students about self-regulation by categorizing all the ways we feel and states of alertness we experience into 4 coloured zones. It helps students notice the emotion they are feeling and then regulate themselves. Learning about the zones not only provides a framework for students to develop self-regulation, but it also allows students, teachers, and parents with a common language to discuss emotions.

You can learn more on the Zones of Regulation by watching the video below!

#### Calming Strategy: Deep Belly Breathing

During intense emotional moments, students may not have the coping skills to calm themselves. Deep belly breathing is a calming exercise that both students and parents can practice to relax and feel grounded. It is best to start practicing deep belly breathing when you are already relaxed. This way, you can build awareness of what being calm feels like. Once you have mastered the deep belly breathing exercise, you can then apply it during distressful moments.

Find out how to do the deep belly breathing exercise by clicking on the video below!
