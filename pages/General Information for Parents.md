School Traffic Management Plan
------------------------------

•       To ensure the safety of motorists and pedestrians within the school compound and the school zone.

•       Parents and caregivers can drop off your child from 6.30 a.m. to 7.30 a.m.

•       Parents are reminded to drop off and move as quickly as possible to facilitate other parents who are waiting.

Parking of vehicles outside the school compound
-----------------------------------------------

•       Parents are to refrain from stopping their vehicles along Segar Close if they need to wait for their children. They are advised to park their vehicles at nearby carparks and wait for their children at side gate A.

School Operating Hours
----------------------

•       The school operates from 6.30 a.m. to 5.00 p.m.

Visit to our School
-------------------

•       For the safety and security of students, all visitors/parents must register at the Security Post.

•       The Visitor Pass must be worn and displayed prominently. No one is allowed to access any part of the school premises without prior permission from the General Office. The school takes a very serious view of this matter.

•       At any point of time, parents are only allowed to wait at the General Office while waiting for their children.

•       School staff will approach any visitor/parent not wearing the Visitor Pass.

•       School car park lots are for staff only. Please park your vehicle at public car parks nearby.

•       We request parents and guardians not to send items to school that your child/ward has forgotten as this disrupts the child’s classroom learning. This is also in line with our objective of inculcating responsibility in students.

•       Parents are required to sign in the Early Dismissal Book in the General Office if you fetch your child before dismissal time.

Change in Personal Particulars
-------------------

•       Parents should keep the school informed through the Form Teacher of any change in personal particulars. For example, address, telephone numbers, etc. Parents can also call the school at 6314 4192 to update your contact details.
