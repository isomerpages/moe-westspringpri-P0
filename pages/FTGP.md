# Form Teacher Guidance Period
# 
**

The Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) enables teachers and students to bond through interaction activities while strengthening students’ social and emotional competencies.

In West Spring Primary School, our CHARacter Matters (CHARM) programme is integrated into our FTGP to enhance our students’ skills and knowledge acquisition and help them develop self and social awareness.

During the lessons, teachers and students not only engage in quality discussions that address specific issues but also participate in play activities that reinforce core values of CCE.
