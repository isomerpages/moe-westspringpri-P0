The Student Leaders Investiture is an event that honors student leaders at all levels of the school for their exceptional dedication to learning and leadership. During the event, the outgoing Executive Committee (Exco) symbolically passes the torch of leadership to newly appointed members, marking the end of one leadership term and the beginning of another. This transition represents the students' commitment to guide and inspire their peers, emphasizing the importance of values like integrity, kindness, teamwork, and purpose.

The ceremony recognizes and celebrates various forms of leadership, including Monitors, Subject Leaders, Peer Support Leaders, ICT Leaders, CCE Leaders, Green Leaders, and Champions in ICT, CCE, Co-Curricular Activities (CCA), and Green initiatives. The event underscores that leadership is not just about titles or positions of authority but about personal growth, learning, and inspiring others. It serves as a powerful reminder of the values and passion that drive our student leaders and the collective commitment to make a positive impact on the school community.
