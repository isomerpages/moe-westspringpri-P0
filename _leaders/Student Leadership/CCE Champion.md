CCE Champions develop leadership skills alongside teaching them to become good citizens within the school community, as well as the wider community. They play an active role in improving the lives of others, and influencing and persuading others to serve the community. It provides the opportunity for students to reach out to the external community through CCE outreach programmes.

Through these programmes, students hone their critical thinking and project management skills as they plan and implement student-led activities. They also have clear set of values and have the ability to inspire others

As a result, an equal emphasis is placed&nbsp; on helping communities and providing relevant learning experiences to the CCE champions.
