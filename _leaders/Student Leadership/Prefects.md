Prefects strive to be a representative voice for the students. In working towards this goal, prefects are committed to establishing and maintaining the highest standards of behaviour, attitude and appearance at all times and provide a positive role model for other West Springers.

  

Prefects also strive to cultivate a sense of belonging to the school community through school activities and initiatives. By engaging the school population in creating a shared identity, prefects seek to forge a strong, close-knit community.
