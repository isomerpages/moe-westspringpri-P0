As student leaders, CCA Champions are given the opportunity to be role models and mentors to members of their respective CCA groups. CCA teachers select students who demonstrate passion in their CCA, exert a positive influence on their fellow members and are able to rally them towards attaining learning goals for each session. Students who are identified undergo basic training to expand their existing repertoire of peer leadership and communication skills. They then apply their learning by working closely with their CCA teachers to manage and motivate fellow CCA members. As part of their development, they will be tasked with general leadership, planning and organizational duties (e.g. attendance taking, leading warm ups and team meetings) with guidance from their teachers. We hope that through this platform, the CCA Champions will grow into Learners driven by Passion and Leaders guided by Values.
