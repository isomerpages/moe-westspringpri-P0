#### 2023

We are thrilled to have hosted a group of students from Global Prestasi School (GPS) in Indonesia from 6 March to 7 March. During their visit, they had the opportunity to attend lessons with their assigned buddies and experience what it's like to be a student in a local school.

Before the visit, the buddies took the initiative to write emails to introduce themselves and share a little about themselves to forge friendships. This was a great way to break the ice and get to know each other before meeting in person.

The CCE leaders from P5A did a fantastic job of presenting our school and took the visitors on a school tour that they planned themselves. The Indonesian students were able to see the different facilities we have in our school and learn more about our school's history.

The students had a lot of fun during the visit. Not only did they make new friends, but they also had the opportunity to learn about each other's culture. It was a great experience for everyone involved and it really helped to promote cultural exchange and understanding.

On the last day, the GPS students showed their appreciation by performing a cultural dance for the West Springers. It was a fantastic display of their traditional culture, and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it. They also exchanged souvenirs to commemorate the visit and the friendships that were made.

Overall, it was a fantastic experience for everyone involved. We hope that this visit has helped to promote greater understanding and appreciation of different cultures, and that it will encourage more students to participate in cultural exchange programs in the future.
