# Values in Action

Values in Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support students’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community.

In WSPS, our students have been actively involved in both school-based and community-based programmes. Students reflect on their experience, the values they have put into practice, and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully.
