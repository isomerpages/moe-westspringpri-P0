# Respecting and Embracing Asian Cultural Heritage (REACH)

Tapping on the affordances of ICT, West Spring Primary had embarked on a series of virtual immersions to Japan, Indonesia and Philippines this year. These immersions are titled REACH (Respecting and Embracing Asian Cultural Heritage). During REACH, we learnt about each other cultures and had a virtual tour of their schools. We also had a chance to teach the students from an overseas school our main languages and crafts from one of our cultural groups. It was an interesting and engaging virtual immersion.
