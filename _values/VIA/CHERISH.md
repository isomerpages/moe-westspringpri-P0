# Creating Heartfelt Appreciation for Staff in School (CHERISH)

As part of the P3 VIA programme, students showed their appreciation to the non-teaching staff in the school by a CARE package. This consisted of a Thank You Card, Food/Drinks coupons and a message board. Upon completion, the P3 CCE leaders handed the packages to the staff.

The staff were delighted to receive the packages, They also displayed the Gratitude board in their respective work stations. These boards featured messages from students expressing their gratitude to the staff.
