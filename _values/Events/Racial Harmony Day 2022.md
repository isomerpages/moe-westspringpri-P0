# Racial Harmony Day 
The school commemorated Racial Harmony Day on Wednesday, 20 July 2022. The theme for this year is ‘Our Multicultural Mosaic’. The students learn that in Singapore, people are treated equally regardless of their race and religion. Thus, students learned to appreciate the different cultures that make up Singapore. They should make friends with people of other races and religions.

3 students from different levels started off the assembly programme by sharing with the school their friendships with their friends from the different ethnic groups. Next, there was a skit about “Unity in Diversity”. Through the skit, students discussed about Singapore’s culture and the way of life in Singapore. A quiz segment was also weaved in at the same time to engage students and help them better understand the importance of racial harmony in Singapore.
