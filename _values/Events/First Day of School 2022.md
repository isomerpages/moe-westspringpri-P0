# First Day of School 2022

On 5 January, we welcomed the rest of the West Springers to their second home! Classrooms are once again filled with laughter and lively activities as students and teachers come together to ignite the passion for learning together! Wishing all our students another exciting and productive school year! We are ready to commence the school term with aspiration, passion and vigour!
