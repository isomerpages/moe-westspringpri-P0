# Children’s Day Celebration 2022

The occasion of Children’s Day reminds us all how special it is to be a child.

On 6 October 2022, we celebrated Children’s Day for the young and the young at heart!

On this day, we celebrated the passions that our West Springers, including the teachers and staff have! The performances were received with overwhelming applause, tons of laughter and joy on the children’s faces!

Here’s our wish for our West Springers! Find your purpose and discover your passions.

Do what you love so you will love what you do!

A very Happy Children’s Day to you!
