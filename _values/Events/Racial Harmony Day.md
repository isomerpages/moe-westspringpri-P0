# Racial Harmony Day 

#### 2023

On 19 July 2023, West Springers commemorated Racial Harmony Day, a day that emphasizes the importance of maintaining racial harmony and social cohesion in Singapore. This year's Racial Harmony Day theme, "Singapore: Our Multicultural Mosaic," focuses on appreciating the diverse races and religions that make up our multicultural society. Our West Springers learned about the importance of racial harmony and engaged in meaningful activities that helped them gain an understanding of our different languages, cultures, and heritages.

The school commemorated Racial Harmony Day on Wednesday, 20 July 2022. The theme for this year is ‘Our Multicultural Mosaic’. The students learn that in Singapore, people are treated equally regardless of their race and religion. Thus, students learned to appreciate the different cultures that make up Singapore. They should make friends with people of other races and religions.
3 students from different levels started off the assembly programme by sharing with the school their friendships with their friends from the different ethnic groups. Next, there was a skit about “Unity in Diversity”. Through the skit, students discussed about Singapore’s culture and the way of life in Singapore. A quiz segment was also weaved in at the same time to engage students and help them better understand the importance of racial harmony in Singapore.
