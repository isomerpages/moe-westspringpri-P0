# Hari Raya Aidilfitri 2023
**

West Springers celebrated Hari Raya Aidilfitri on Wednesday, 26 April 2023.&nbsp; The theme for this year's celebration is Gempak Raya. This year, we highlighted 3 misconceptions on Hari Raya Celebration through a skit. Students learned on how someone can wish a Muslim on Hari Raya, is there a need for color coordinated clothes and also the act of giving or sharing with others. On top of that, we featured some of our Malay culture. Hence, performances by the talents of West Springers were showcased through Dikir Barat, Kompang and Tarian. The celebration ended with West Springers sing-along to a Raya Sudah Tiba song following to a tune of Rasa Sayang Eh.

During the recess activities, West Springers got the opportunity to experience various activities, such as creating a Raya decoration using origami papers, tanjak making and playing Kompang. There was also a photobooth for West Springers to take photos with their friends!

This was certainly a new, yet enjoyable experience for them where the whole school come together to celebrate Hari Raya. We hope all of them had enjoyed the performances and learn something new.

Stay safe and Selamat Hari Raya to all, Maaf Zahir dan Batin!

# Hari Raya Aidilfitri 2022
West Springers celebrated Hari Raya Aidilfitri with a live and pre-recorded concert on Wednesday, 4 May 2022. The theme for this yearâ€™s celebration is Kampung West Spring.

Prior to the event, the Primary 1 to Primary 6 students taking the Malay language had had their Craft@Raya done in class or through SLS.

Before the concert, the students watched interviews of their non-Muslim friends celebrating Hari Raya with their neighbours. They also watched how other West Springers celebrated this festive occasion at the kampung before Covid-19.

During the concert, the MK children and West Springers showcased their talents through many performances such as boria, kompang, dance and the playing of musical instruments. We also had a quiz on Hari Raya cookies. To end of the session, the students and staff of West Spring danced to a catchy Hari Raya song.

This was certainly a new, yet enjoyable experience for everyone at West Spring.

Wishing everyone a Selamat Hari Raya.
