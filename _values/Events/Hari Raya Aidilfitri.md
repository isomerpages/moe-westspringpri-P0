# Hari Raya Aidilfitri 2022
West Springers celebrated Hari Raya Aidilfitri with a live and pre-recorded concert on Wednesday, 4 May 2022. The theme for this yearâ€™s celebration is Kampung West Spring.

Prior to the event, the Primary 1 to Primary 6 students taking the Malay language had had their Craft@Raya done in class or through SLS.

Before the concert, the students watched interviews of their non-Muslim friends celebrating Hari Raya with their neighbours. They also watched how other West Springers celebrated this festive occasion at the kampung before Covid-19.

During the concert, the MK children and West Springers showcased their talents through many performances such as boria, kompang, dance and the playing of musical instruments. We also had a quiz on Hari Raya cookies. To end of the session, the students and staff of West Spring danced to a catchy Hari Raya song.

This was certainly a new, yet enjoyable experience for everyone at West Spring.

Wishing everyone a Selamat Hari Raya.
