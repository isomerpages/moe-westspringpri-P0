# Hari Raya Aidilfitri 2023


On Wednesday, 26 April 2023, West Springers celebrated Hari Raya Aidilfitri with the theme "Gempak Raya". This year's celebration focused on dispelling three misconceptions about Hari Raya through a skit. Students learned about how to wish Muslims on Hari Raya, whether wearing color-coordinated clothes was necessary, and the significance of giving and sharing with others. The event also featured various performances showcasing our Malay culture, including Dikir Barat, Kompang, and Tarian. The celebration ended on a high note with West Springers singing along to the Raya Sudah Tiba song, following the tune of Rasa Sayang Eh.

During recess, West Springers participated in various activities such as creating Raya decorations using origami paper, making tanjaks, and playing Kompang. A photobooth was also set up for them to capture memories with their friends.

It was a memorable experience for everyone, as the entire school came together to celebrate Hari Raya. We hope that all of them enjoyed the performances and learned something new.

Stay safe and Selamat Hari Raya to all! Maaf Zahir dan Batin!

# Hari Raya Aidilfitri 2022
West Springers celebrated Hari Raya Aidilfitri with a live and pre-recorded concert on Wednesday, 4 May 2022. The theme for this yearâ€™s celebration is Kampung West Spring.

Prior to the event, the Primary 1 to Primary 6 students taking the Malay language had had their Craft@Raya done in class or through SLS.

Before the concert, the students watched interviews of their non-Muslim friends celebrating Hari Raya with their neighbours. They also watched how other West Springers celebrated this festive occasion at the kampung before Covid-19.

During the concert, the MK children and West Springers showcased their talents through many performances such as boria, kompang, dance and the playing of musical instruments. We also had a quiz on Hari Raya cookies. To end of the session, the students and staff of West Spring danced to a catchy Hari Raya song.

This was certainly a new, yet enjoyable experience for everyone at West Spring.

Wishing everyone a Selamat Hari Raya.
