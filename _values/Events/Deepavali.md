# Deepavali Celebration 2022

West Springers gathered for the Deepavali celebration on 9 November 2022. The event started off with a light-up ceremony by our School Leaders. This ceremony signifies the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. Following that, performers displayed their talents through a variety of performances. The audience also got into the celebratory mood by dancing along to Indian music beats. Thereafter, teachers and students dressed up in Indian wear and did a catwalk for the Fashion Parade segment. After an enjoyable concert, students tried their hands at Murukku Making as part of the recess activities. Parents from the Parent Support Group also added on to the experience by drawing Henna art on studentsâ€™ hands. Through this enriching and engaging celebration, students learned more about the significance and customs of Deepavali and the Indian culture.
