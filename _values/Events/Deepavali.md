# Deepavali Celebration 2023

On 15th November, our school lit up with the vibrant colors and joyous celebrations of Deepavali! ðŸª”âœ¨ The atmosphere was filled with music, dance and an awe-inspiring martial arts performance that left our staff and students absolutely wowed!

After the concert, students delved into the heart of Indian culture during our recess activity. Creativity flowed as students participated in the mesmerizing Rangoli art activity, creating intricate and colorful patterns. Our Parent Volunteers and art club students added an extra touch of elegance by drawing Henna art, allowing our students to immerse themselves in the beauty of this ancient art form.

In all, the Deepavali celebration served as a wonderful opportunity for our students to learn, understand and appreciate the rich and diverse tapestry of Indian tradition and culture.
