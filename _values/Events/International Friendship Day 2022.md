# International Friendship Day 2022
On 6 April, we celebrated International Friendship Day during the assembly.

The theme for this yearâ€™s International Friendship Day is Singapore in Asia. International cooperation remains key in our complex world. By recognising the importance of connectedness between our neighbouring countries, we can play an active role in fostering people-to-people ties, and thus celebrate the region's diversity and vibrancy and promote the spirit of friendship and collaboration.

In the assembly programme, our fellow schoolmates have shared about the colourful cultures and traditions of ASEAN and other Asian countries. We also got to learn more about the lives of our friends overseas. Finally, the Primary 6s shared about what they have learnt from the REACH (Respecting and Embracing Asian Cultural Heritage) virtual immersions last year. We had a very enriching time learning about the other countries and their cultures!
