# Teachers' Day Celebration 2022

Teachers' Day Celebrations

On 1st September, West Springers came to school all prepared to shower their appreciation and love on their teachers. The morning started with a special concert by students for their teachers. Following that, students welcomed their Form Teachers to their classrooms to begin the second part of the celebrations. Form Teachers enjoyed classroom performances that their students had secretly planned for them. After the school celebrations, the parade square was bustling with ex-students, eagerly reconnecting with their teachers and peers. At the end of the day, everyone left school with their hearts and minds filled with gratitude and memories.
