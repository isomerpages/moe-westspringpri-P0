# National Day Celebration

#### 2023

On 8 August, we came together in a sea of red and white to celebrate our nation’s 58th birthday. This year, we embraced the theme 'Onward as One' in our concert and classroom activities. We reaffirmed our commitment towards nation-building with an observance ceremony and recollections. This was followed by a skit that was split into three acts, each focusing on a different part of Singapore’s past, present, and future. We drew on valuable lessons that we can learn from our history: resilience, unity, and inclusivity. Student leaders took charge of leading the school in performing sign language to the song "The Road Ahead," reflecting the importance of unity and inclusivity. We ended the concert by reflecting on how far we’ve come as we enjoyed the medley of past National Day songs, from "One People, One Nation, One Singapore" to "Shine Your Light."

Majulah, Singapura!

After two years of celebrating National Day in our classrooms, we are finally celebrating it together in the school hall! The students from MOE Kindergarten also came and joined in the celebration. The theme for this year’s National Day is Stronger Together, Majulah. It is a call for all Singaporeans to forge ahead as a united and strong people towards a better future. The success of our National Day celebration does not belong to one but to many. We had students from different CCAs, classes, levels and teachers from various departments coming together to plan and perform. Indeed, we are stronger together!

Happy 57th National Day!
