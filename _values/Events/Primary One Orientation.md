“The beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it from you.” – BB King, a musician.

West Spring welcomed our Primary One learners today! On 4 January, we held our Primary One orientation for the students and parents. Parents of the Primary One students attended the Class Engagement session where they had an enriching time having a taste of what the Primary One curriculum is like. They also got to observe their children buying their first plate of food during the Primary 1 recess!
