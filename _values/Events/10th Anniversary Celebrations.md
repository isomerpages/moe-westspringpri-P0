#### September

This month, our school celebrated its 10th Anniversary with a Mathematics@Play event. The celebration started with an assembly on September 13th. The students were engaged in a binary game and became even more excited when they had the opportunity to watch their schoolmates present the SLS E-lesson on Pi. Mathematics@Play continued with more fun activities held at the Parade Square during recess on two days. Our West Springers participated in various activities in the Physical Playzone with Roman Numbers up to 10, a Cognitive Playzone with Binary Digits 1 and 0, Matchstick Puzzles, the Magic Triangle of 10, and an ICT Playzone involving Multiplication within 10.

The event also featured a presentation by Daniel, a student from 4C, about his passion for coding. He also created an ICT Multiplication game for the event. The event was supported by our wonderful Parent Support Group (PSG), who guided our West Springers through these exciting games! The event was a great way for our West Springers to learn about mathematics in a fun and engaging way, and it also celebrated our school's 10th Anniversary.

#### August
 
West Spring Primary School's 10th Anniversary celebrations are a testament to its vibrant and nurturing community. Led by our student leaders, our August celebration revolves around the theme "Inspiring Others, Making a Positive Impact." The domino structure forming the word INSPIRE, symbolizing unity and strength, reflects the collective efforts of our student leaders to create a chain reaction of positive change in our school community. A video clip showcasing their inspiring spirit highlighted their dedication and creativity during preparations for this mini celebration. With the toppling of the dominoes, it serves as a powerful visual representation of our school's growth and potential for even greater achievements in the future.

In the celebration finale, the entire school participated in the engaging giant ball relay, promoting teamwork, camaraderie, and a strong sense of belonging among the students. It ended with a resounding roar of “Happy Birthday, West Spring!”.

Our Parent Support Group extended the celebration festivities through domino-building activities during recesses, where inspiring words representing the school's 10-year journey were constructed. This collaboration strengthens the connection between parents and the school and emphasizes the shared partnership in fostering a positive learning environment.

Our 10th Anniversary monthly celebration becomes an inspiring and joyous occasion, leaving a lasting impression on all West Springers, fostering a sense of pride and unity among students, staff, and parents, and setting the stage for a promising future for West Spring Primary School! Our September celebration is greatly anticipated by our West Springers! Just like our West Springers, we are looking forward to it too!

#### June - July


Hello parents and West Springers, we are back with more mini celebrations of our school’s 10th Anniversary for June and July!

In end June, we welcomed and celebrated our 10th anniversary by highlighting our Purposeful Learning Activities for the Young (PLAY) Outdoors! - Learning for Life Programme (LLP), which focuses on experiential learning in, about and through the outdoors. Our West Springers were encouraged to go outdoors to learn and play with their family and friends. They then shared their playful and adventurous outdoor learning experiences though photographs and videos via our Student Learning Space (SLS). We saw West Springers share pictorial memories of their outdoor play and learning in various places of Singapore such as their neighbourhoods, green spaces, nature parks, beaches, zoos, and many other interesting places. Our PLAY Outdoors! LLP places a strong emphasis on real-life outdoor experiential learning. It aims to nurture confident and curious West Springers who are comfortable in the outdoors, exhibit a "dare-to-try" spirit, passionate about exploring both the natural and urban environments and take action to care for the environment. By welcoming new learning experiences and embracing challenges and adventures with a positive attitude, our West Springers become adept at managing themselves, building relationships with others and interacting harmoniously with the environment.

In July, the school's 10th-anniversary celebration highlights the success of the Mother Tongue Fortnight (MT Fortnight), which aims to enhance our West Springers' proficiency in their mother tongue language and foster cultural appreciation. Various interactive activities, such as poem recitations, 'tudung saji' crafting, and tea appreciation, engaged our West Springers in language and cultural experiences. During recess, there were many activity stations, spanning across the mother tongue languages. Our West Springers were immensed in a myriad of activities such as angklung playing, 'shooting' Chinese characters, and flower garland making. The event and activities encourage our West Springers to connect with their cultural roots, develop language skills, and understand their identities. The anniversary also featured community singing in multiple languages and a virtual tour of past MT Fortnight events, promoting unity and reminiscing cherished memories.

West Spring Primary School celebrates its 10th anniversary with strong support from the staff and parent support group, actively engaging in recess activities. Our school focuses on deepening its identity for students, seeking meaningful anniversary activities. Together with parents and staff, we aim to create an unforgettable and inspiring experience for our West Springers, celebrating a decade of growth and learning while setting the stage for a bright future.

Let’s look forward to our upcoming August 10th Anniversary celebrations!

#### May

Our school celebrated its 10th anniversary with a focus on its Applied Learning Programme (ALP), which emphasizes the theme of "Sustaining the Earth through Advocacy and Solutioning" (SEAS). The programme focuses on environmental protection, responsible resource management, and innovative problem-solving approaches for environmental sustainability challenges. West Springers were invited to conceptualize and design the school's ALP logo, expressing their creativity and understanding of the importance of sustainability. Getting students' input in this design would foster a sense of ownership and pride among students and also reinforce the significance of their contribution in shaping the identity and values of our school. The logo will represent the school's commitment to environmental consciousness and sustainability and be an essential part of the programme.

As part of our 10th anniversary recess activity, our Parent Support Group (PSG) facilitated an activity called "Don't Forget the Lyrics: School Song Edition." West Springers were challenged with filling in the missing lyrics for the school song using an iPad. This was a fun and interactive way for West Springers to deepen their connection with our school. Following the activity, our West Springers were excited to sing our school song with pride. Celebrating our school's milestone through this activity helped foster a sense of community and school spirit among our West Springers.

Our May 10th anniversary celebration at WSPS was another great success! The activities deepened our appreciation for the school's identity and values. It was so much fun for our 10th! Let’s look forward to our June/July 10th celebrations!

#### April

West Spring Primary School (WSPS) celebrated its 10th anniversary with a focus on the theme of "Our West Spring Identity" to encourage students to explore their identity as a member of the West Spring community. The celebration began with a video montage featuring students and alumni reflecting on the different elements that contribute to their identity and what makes WSPS unique. This was followed by a live assembly where students and teachers shared their thoughts and perspectives on what makes WSPS special, and each class contributed a word or phrase that represented the school's identity. The resulting word cloud was published on the school website for all to see, promoting reflection on the school's identity and what makes it special.

The Parent Support Group (PSG) also prepared exciting recess activities for West Springers, including a word tile activity and a Values Quest activity. The word tile activity allowed students to internalize the school's core values in a fun and interactive manner, while the Values Quest activity allowed for deeper reflection and sharing of personal experiences with peers. Both activities aimed to promote reflection, collaboration, and engagement among students.

Our April 10th anniversary celebration at WSPS was a great success, promoting a greater appreciation for the school's identity and core values. So much of buzz and excitement for our 10th! Let’s look forward to our May 10th celebrations!

#### March

Hello everyone! We are coming to the end of Term 1 for 2023! Time has flown by while we were all enjoying the various learning experiences in our school! Have you all been enjoying our 10th Anniversary monthly celebrations so far? Well, your energetic beats and voices spoke volumes during our January and February celebrations! It was good to see all of us coming together to celebrate our joyous 10th! Our 10th Anniversary celebration continues in the month of March.

Our March 10th Anniversary celebration reminisced on our ongoing journey since 2014 till date, showcasing how our West Springers have been demonstrating personal and social responsibility throughout these years. During this celebration, two West Springers "time-travelled" back to 2014 and witnessed the A.C.T.I.V.A.T.E program. They were guided by our teacher, who explained how our West Springers have practised personal and social responsibility through this program. The two time-travellers then brought our teacher back to the current time of 2023 to show how our West Springers, including alumni, have continued to grow and contribute to our community through various programmes and they even shared about their Value in Action (VIA) experiences

Our teacher was impressed and heartened to see how our West Springers have continued our good tradition to contribute and make a positive impact on our community. Our two plucky West Springers then rallied everyone to contribute their ideas on how they can demonstrate personal and social responsibility or other positive actions for the betterment of our community. As part of the ongoing celebrations, our West Springers will be sharing ideas on how they can continue to contribute to our community. This synergistic effort will help ensure that our West Springers continue to make a positive impact on our community for many years to come. What a meaningful time journey this has been!

Our Parent Support Group (PSG) held a puzzle challenge during recess on March 10th, 2023, to celebrate the school's 10th anniversary. The aim was to complete the school's 10th-anniversary passion logo in the shortest time possible. The challenge was a success, promoting teamwork and collaboration amongst our West Springers, and fostering a sense of community within our school. It was a fun and engaging activity that promoted student involvement. Upon the completion of this puzzle, our West Springers shared their passion and made our 10th even more memorable and enjoyable!

Here's sharing our videos and photos with you for our March celebrations! Try spotting yourself in these pictures and videos and share them with your parents!

We are just so excited about all the upcoming 10th Anniversary celebrations! Stay tuned to this space for updates on our 10th Anniversary celebrations as we journey on in April! See you!

#### February

Hello everyone! Are you all settling in well to the school’s routines after a month? Do you still remember what we have done last month (in Jan) to start off with our 10th Anniversary celebrations? Yes! The energetic celebration with lots of movement and sounds where all West Springers and staff were drumming to the beat of body percussion rhythmic beats, movements, and actions! Our 10th Anniversary celebration continues in the month of February.

On 8 Feb 2023, our West Springers participated in a communal painting activity during the recesses. In this activity, West Springers and staff applied the ‘Gotong Royong’ community spirit to produce works of art collaboratively. In addition, Mr Kamal Dollah, a Singaporean artist who specialises in batik painting, co-created these artworks too! The finished art pieces will be hung at the school foyer to welcome our West Springers, staff, parents and visitors in the future. Big thank you to all staff and students who had participated and left an impression on these beautiful art pieces!

Happening on the same week on 10 Feb 2023 during recess, our Parent Support Group (PSG) actively engaged our West Springers by showing them the places around our school. Our West Springers shared their favourite memories and experiences of these places and the reason why the places were so special to them. These special moments / key words were then formed through a word cloud into the shape of WSPS school logo! What a wonderful way to celebrate our February 10th Anniversary celebrations! Thank you, PSG members!

Here's sharing our videos and photos with you for our February celebrations! Enjoy!

With exciting celebrations in January and February, can you guess what we are going to do for our March 10th Anniversary celebration? Stay tune to this space for more updates on our 10th Anniversary celebrations as we journey on in March!
