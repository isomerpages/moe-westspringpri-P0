#### February

Hello everyone! Are you all settling in well to the school’s routines after a month? Do you still remember what we have done last month (in Jan) to start off with our 10th Anniversary celebrations? Yes! The energetic celebration with lots of movement and sounds where all West Springers and staff were drumming to the beat of body percussion rhythmic beats, movements, and actions! Our 10th Anniversary celebration continues in the month of February.

On 8 Feb 2023, our West Springers participated in a communal painting activity during the recesses. In this activity, West Springers and staff applied the ‘Gotong Royong’ community spirit to produce works of art collaboratively. In addition, Mr Kamal Dollah, a Singaporean artist who specialises in batik painting, co-created these artworks too! The finished art pieces will be hung at the school foyer to welcome our West Springers, staff, parents and visitors in the future. Big thank you to all staff and students who had participated and left an impression on these beautiful art pieces!

Happening on the same week on 10 Feb 2023 during recess, our Parent Support Group (PSG) actively engaged our West Springers by showing them the places around our school. Our West Springers shared their favourite memories and experiences of these places and the reason why the places were so special to them. These special moments / key words were then formed through a word cloud into the shape of WSPS school logo! What a wonderful way to celebrate our February 10th Anniversary celebrations! Thank you, PSG members!

Here's sharing our videos and photos with you for our February celebrations! Enjoy!

With exciting celebrations in January and February, can you guess what we are going to do for our March 10th Anniversary celebration? Stay tune to this space for more updates on our 10th Anniversary celebrations as we journey on in March!

#### January

Do you know that West Spring Primary School is in the beautiful community of Bukit Panjang for 10 years already? We have so many fond memories of our West Spring family! It is a significant and an important year for us and we will be celebrating our 10th Anniversary throughout 2023 monthly!

On 4 Jan 2023, on the first day of school for all West Springers, we had our very first energetic celebration with lots of movement and sounds! All West Springers and staff were in this together, through a series of body percussion rhythmic beats, movements, and actions. Led by our talented and passionate teachers, all of us ushered in our 2023 and our first 10th Anniversary celebrations with excitement!&nbsp;

Not forgetting our important partner of West Spring Primary School, our Parent Support Group (PSG). On 10 Jan 2023, our Parent Support Group conducted a series of recess activities related to our 10th Anniversary to further excite our West Springers! Thank you, PSG for partnering us in our celebrations!
