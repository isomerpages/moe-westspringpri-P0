# Total Defence Day

#### 2023

On 15 February, we had an amazing assembly performance at our school in commemoration of Total Defence Day. The Primary 2 students and teachers came together to act out the 6 pillars of Total Defence, and it was truly an inspiring sight.

The assembly began with a group of students leading the pledges for the 6 pillars of total defence which are Military Defence, Civil Defence, Economic Defence, Social Defence, Psychological Defence, and Digital Defence. It was heartening to see so many students showing their commitment to defend our country in every way possible.

Following this, the students and teachers acted out skits that showcased the importance of each pillar of defence. It was incredible to see the creativity and passion that went into these performances. We also had a group of young rappers who rapped about the pillars of Total Defence in a fun and engaging way!

We want to thank all the students who submitted their pledges in the SLS. Your commitment to defending our country is truly inspiring, and we are proud to have you as part of our school community.

15 February assembly was a reminder of the importance of Total Defence Day and what it means to be a responsible citizen. We hope that everyone who was in attendance will carry this message forward and continue to work towards building a safer and more secure future for all.

#### 2022
West Spring Primary School commemorated Total Defence Day (TDD) on Wednesday, 16th February 2022. This event serves to remind us of what Singapore could be like if we are not able to defend ourselves. Total Defence has guided us through many difficult times. One example would be our nation’s fight against the ongoing COVID-19.

2022's Total Defence campaign – “Together We Keep Singapore Strong” – focused on the many ways we can incorporate Total Defence into our daily lives. As part of the commemoration, our students will learn about the significance of Total Defence and the six pillars through the morning assembly programme and activities infused into the lessons.
