# First Day of School 2023

On the second day of school reopening, the students were all smiles as they arrived at school. They greeted each other with enthusiastic spirits and were excited to be reunited with their friends. Classrooms were filled with laughter and chatter as the students eagerly participated in classroom activities and caught up with one another on all the events that happened during their vacation.

During recess, the students remained in high spirits. The Primary 4s were buddies to the Primary 1s where they guided them on what to do during recess. It was clear that they were thrilled to be back at school and that they were making the most of every moment.

Overall, the second day of school reopening was a joyful and memorable one for the students. Students were happy, cheerful, and helpful throughout the day.
