# Chinese New Year Celebration 2022
West Springers celebrated Chinese New Year via an e-concert on 31 January 2022.

To kickstart the day, our students made some crafts related to the event in the Chinese New Yearâ€™s Arts Alive segment. Thereafter, students spring-cleaned the classrooms before decorating them.

The next segment consists of students showcasing their talents through many performances such as the lion dance, cross talk and the Season Drum performance.

Some of our teachers and students also shared with us how they would usually celebrate Chinese New Year at home. Students also got to learn more about the traditions and meaning behind Chinese New Year.

Finally, students got the chance to dance along to a Chinese New Year song in a line dance segment.

This was certainly a new, yet enjoyable experience for them. We hope all of them had enjoyed the performances.

Stay safe and Xin Nian Kuai Le ( Happy Chinese New Year) to all.
