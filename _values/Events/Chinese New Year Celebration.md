# Chinese New Year Celebration 

#### 2023

West Springers celebrated the Chinese New Year on 18 January and 1 February 2023.

On 18 January, students participated in a range of recess activities. With the help of our parent volunteers, students got the opportunity to experience various activities such as Chinese Calligraphy, Finger Print Drawing, Greeting Card Making, Origami Rabbit Making and Lion Dancing.

On 1 February, students showcased their talents through many performances such as Lion Dancing, Chinese Opera, a Percussion Performance and an Wushu Performance. Some of our teachers and parents also joined us in a dragon dance performance! The celebration ended with our West Springers singing and dancing along to a Chinese New Year song medley.

This was certainly a new, yet enjoyable experience for our West Springers where the whole school was able to come together to celebrate Chinese New Year at the hall since Covid started. We hope that all of our students enjoyed the performances.

Stay safe and Xin Nian Kuai Le ( Happy Chinese New Year) to all!

#### 2022 

West Springers celebrated Chinese New Year via an e-concert on 31 January 2022.

To kickstart the day, our students made some crafts related to the event in the Chinese New Yearâ€™s Arts Alive segment. Thereafter, students spring-cleaned the classrooms before decorating them.

The next segment consists of students showcasing their talents through many performances such as the lion dance, cross talk and the Season Drum performance.

Some of our teachers and students also shared with us how they would usually celebrate Chinese New Year at home. Students also got to learn more about the traditions and meaning behind Chinese New Year.

Finally, students got the chance to dance along to a Chinese New Year song in a line dance segment.

This was certainly a new, yet enjoyable experience for them. We hope all of them had enjoyed the performances.

Stay safe and Xin Nian Kuai Le ( Happy Chinese New Year) to all.
