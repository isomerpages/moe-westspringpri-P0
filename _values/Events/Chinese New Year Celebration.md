# Chinese New Year Celebration 

#### 2024

Our West Spring family celebrated Chinese New Year on 9 February 2024.

The event was a fantastic showcase of Chinese culture, with a variety of activities that brought the festive spirit to life.

The highlight of the celebration was the mesmerizing lion dance and dragon dance performances by our West Springers. The rhythmic beats of drums and cymbals, combined with the graceful movements of the performers, created an unforgettable experience for everyone.

Our students also had the opportunity to watch a performance by our talented Wushu CCA students, where students showcased their martial arts skills with enthusiasm and passion.

To end off the celebrations at the parade square, the students and teachers came together to sing Chinese New Year songs. It was heartwarming to see everyone joining in and celebrating together.

After the parade square segment, students were engaged in various activities back in the classroom, where they created beautiful Chinese New Year decorations and crafts. These activities not only allowed them to be creative but also helped them learn more about Chinese culture and traditions.

We hope that all our West Springers have enjoyed the performances and activities during the celebrations.

Wishing everyone a blessed and prosperous lunar new year!

#### 2023

West Springers celebrated the Chinese New Year on 18 January and 1 February 2023.

On 18 January, students participated in a range of recess activities. With the help of our parent volunteers, students got the opportunity to experience various activities such as Chinese Calligraphy, Finger Print Drawing, Greeting Card Making, Origami Rabbit Making and Lion Dancing.

On 1 February, students showcased their talents through many performances such as Lion Dancing, Chinese Opera, a Percussion Performance and an Wushu Performance. Some of our teachers and parents also joined us in a dragon dance performance! The celebration ended with our West Springers singing and dancing along to a Chinese New Year song medley.

This was certainly a new, yet enjoyable experience for our West Springers where the whole school was able to come together to celebrate Chinese New Year at the hall since Covid started. We hope that all of our students enjoyed the performances.

Stay safe and Xin Nian Kuai Le ( Happy Chinese New Year) to all!

West Springers celebrated Chinese New Year via an e-concert on 31 January 2022.

To kickstart the day, our students made some crafts related to the event in the Chinese New Yearâ€™s Arts Alive segment. Thereafter, students spring-cleaned the classrooms before decorating them.

The next segment consists of students showcasing their talents through many performances such as the lion dance, cross talk and the Season Drum performance.

Some of our teachers and students also shared with us how they would usually celebrate Chinese New Year at home. Students also got to learn more about the traditions and meaning behind Chinese New Year.

Finally, students got the chance to dance along to a Chinese New Year song in a line dance segment.

This was certainly a new, yet enjoyable experience for them. We hope all of them had enjoyed the performances.

Stay safe and Xin Nian Kuai Le ( Happy Chinese New Year) to all.
