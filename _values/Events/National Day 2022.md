# National Day Celebration 2022
Majulah, Singapura!

After two years of celebrating National Day in our classrooms, we are finally celebrating it together in the school hall! The students from MOE Kindergarten also came and joined in the celebration. The theme for this yearâ€™s National Day is Stronger Together, Majulah. It is a call for all Singaporeans to forge ahead as a united and strong people towards a better future. The success of our National Day celebration does not belong to one but to many. We had students from different CCAs, classes, levels and teachers from various departments coming together to plan and perform. Indeed, we are stronger together!

Happy 57th National Day!
