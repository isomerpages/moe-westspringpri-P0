The **HI-Light Programme** supports the **holistic development** of children through an **integrated approach** to learning. It ignites the joy of learning in children. 

As children learn holistically from their experiences and do not compartmentalise what they learn, the learning experiences in the HI-Light Programme are planned as a whole to help children make sense of the world around them. 

Through the HI-Light Programme, your child will be nurtured holistically in the following learning areas:
* Aesthetics and Creative Expression
* Discovery of the World
* Language and Literacy
* Motor Skills Development
* Numeracy
* Social and Emotional Development
