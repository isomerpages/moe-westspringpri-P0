The **Starlight Literacy Programme** aims to nurture **early childhood bilingualism**. 

Offered in English and the **three Mother Tongue Languages**, the programme provides opportunities for children to enjoy English and their Mother Tongue Language, communicate with confidence and be aware of local traditions and customs. 
Language learning is made fun for children through the use of a **rich variety of resources such as Big Books, songs and games set in the local context**. 

Families are also involved in childrenâ€™s learning through activities that children can do together with their family members. Through the programme, your child will **develop listening, speaking and early literacy skills** which will help lay a **strong foundation for language learning** in later years.
