### (LIFE@MK: K2 Transition Talk)
###
**L**eading and **I**nspiring **F**amilies of **E**arly Learners @ MOE Kindergarten (or **LIFE@MK** in short) is a series of workshops to encourage families to be more involved in and gain a deeper understanding of their childrenâ€™s holistic development in the pre-school years.

# Discover West Spring 2023 

At MOE Kindergarten, we believe that parents play a crucial role in their child's education and we want to partner with you to ensure your child's success. 

On May 19, 2023, we partnered West Spring Primary School to invite our K2 parents from MK @ West Spring as well as the public for a K2 Transition Talk. 
It provided an invaluable opportunity for families, prospective students, and our school community to come together and connect. In addition to sharing information about our how MK supports the children to ensure a smooth transition to primary school, it was also an opportunity for parents to meet our dedicated staff, tour our classrooms and facilities and learn about West Spring Primary's innovative programmes and curriculum.&nbsp;We extend our gratitude to all who attended and contributed to the success of this event!

We have uploaded the LIFE@MK slides for our MK parents (password encrypted)
