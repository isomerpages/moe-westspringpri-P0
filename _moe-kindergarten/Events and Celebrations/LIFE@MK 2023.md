**L**eading and **I**nspiring **F**amilies of **E**arly Learners @ MOE Kindergarten (or **LIFE@MK** in short) is a series of workshops to encourage families to be more involved in and gain a deeper understanding of their children’s holistic development in the pre-school years.

# LIFE@MK (K2 Transition Talk) + Discover West Spring 2023

At MOE Kindergarten @ West Spring, we believe that parents play a crucial role in their child's education and we want to partner with you to ensure your child's success. Parents were invited to attend the **LIFE@MK** on 19 May 2023, where we shared about how we prepare our MK children for a smooth transition to Primary One. 

In addition, we have partnered West Spring Primary to invite parents to **Discover West Spring Primary 2023**! It was an opportunity for parents to meet our dedicated staff, tour our classrooms and facilities and learn about our innovative programmes and curriculum.
