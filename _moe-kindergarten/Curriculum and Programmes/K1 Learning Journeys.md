# Neighbourhood Walk
As we explored the topic on “My Neighbourhood”, we learnt about the people and places in the neighbourhood and the importance of building positive relationships with the people around them. We went on our first field trip, a Neighbourhood Walk, to observe and make new discoveries about the people, places and features in their neighbourhood! Let’s check out on our adventure!

# Police Visit
On 18 May 2023, the children were visited by the police. This Learning Journey was arranged to extend their learning on the topic of "My Neighbourhood". 

The policemen shared with the children about stranger danger, and also brought along some police equipment and a police car for the children to explore. The children were very excited by this visit. Share in their excitement by checking out the photo gallery below!
