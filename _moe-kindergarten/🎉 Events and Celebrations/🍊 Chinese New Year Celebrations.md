<h4>Chinese New Year Celebration 2024</h4>
<p>The children in MK celebrated Chinese New Year in two parts: Firstly,
they were involved in spring cleaning and classroom decoration in the week
leading up to the actual day of celebration, which allowed them to experience
what the Chinese will do to prepare for Chinese New Year.</p>
<p>Secondly, on the actual day of celebration (9th Feb 2024), our MK children
joined the primary school students at the parade square for a mass celebration.
In addition to a series of performances put up by the primary school, a
group of our K2 children were also on stage to perform 《送你一个大年糕》. Once
back in their classrooms, the children were engaged in activities before
ending the day off with the receiving of red packets (consisting of well-wishes
card and stickers).</p>
