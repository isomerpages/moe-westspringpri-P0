<h3>National Day Celebration 2024</h3>
<p>“Together, As One United People” is the theme for this year’s celebration.
It highlights the collective strength of our people. Our MK children enjoyed
singing the theme song “Not Alone” and dancing together with their classmates
to ‘Dance of the Nation’. The song’s chorus “The more we’re together, the
further we’ll go” has an impactful meaning in relation to raising our MK
children as a whole village. Families, school and the community have been
coming together to provide tremendous support and opportunities for our
childrens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of our MK children were involved as flag bearers while another group
performed on stage as part of the combined celebration with the primary
school. The performance showcased all three races (Malay, Chinese and Indian)
coming together in a dance,representing the theme, ‘Together , As One United
People’.</p>

<h4>National Day Celebration 2023</h4>
<p>On 8 August 2023, students and staff from West Spring Primary School and
MK @ West Spring gathered together in the school hall to celebrate Singapore's
58th birthday. After the flag-raising and observance ceremony, the students
from the primary school put up various acts following the themes of Resilience,
