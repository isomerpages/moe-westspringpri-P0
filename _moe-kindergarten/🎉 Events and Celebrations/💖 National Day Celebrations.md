<h3>National Day Celebration 2025</h3>
<p>On 8th August 2025, we held a combined celebration with West Spring Primary
School where some of our MK children had an opportunity to participate
as flag bearers and performers. The performance incorporated 3 cultural
dances (Chinese - “Mo Li Hua”, Malay - “Geylang Si Paku Geylang” &amp;
Indian - “Engkal Singapore”) showcasing the idea of being united as one.
Furthermore, children had a blast singing and dancing to this year's NDP
song 'Here We Are'. They were also engaged in listening to past years collection
of NDP songs and enjoyed dancing to the SG GetActive Workout. It was indeed
a fun and memorable event!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>National Day Celebration 2024</h3>
<p>“Together, As One United People” is the theme for this year’s celebration.
It highlights the collective strength of our people. Our MK children enjoyed
singing the theme song “Not Alone” and dancing together with their classmates
to ‘Dance of the Nation’. The song’s chorus “The more we’re together, the
further we’ll go” has an impactful meaning in relation to raising our MK
children as a whole village. Families, school and the community have been
coming together to provide tremendous support and opportunities for our
childrens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of our MK children were involved as flag bearers while another group
performed on stage as part of the combined celebration with the primary
school. The performance showcased all three races (Malay, Chinese and Indian)
coming together in a dance,representing the theme, ‘Together , As One United
People’.</p>

<h4>National Day Celebration 2023</h4>
