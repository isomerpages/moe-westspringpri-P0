On 8 August 2023, students and staff from West Spring Primary School and MK @ West Spring gathered together in the school hall to celebrate Singapore's 58th birthday. After the flag-raising and observance ceremony, the students from the primary school put up various acts following the themes of Resilience, Unity and Inclusivity. In between the acts, there was also a lively dance performance to the song of â€˜Singapore Townâ€™ by our very own MK children!
