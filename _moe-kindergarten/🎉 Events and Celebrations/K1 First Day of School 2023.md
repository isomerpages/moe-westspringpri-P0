Welcome back to a new school year!

It was so wonderful to see the smiling faces of our K1 children for the first time, as they embark on their kindergarten journey with MK @ West Spring. 

As part of the K1 Orientation, parents were invited to enter the school with their child as they experienced various ice-breaker activities.
