At MK @ West Spring, we celebrate Children's Day in conjunction with our Literacy Day- which we call JELLY Day (**J**ust **E**njoy the **L**anguage and **L**iteracy around **Y**ou)!

On 6 October 2022, the children came do to school dressed up as their favourite storybook characters. They had great fun participating in various activities such as the interclass competition, Kahoot quizzes, Starlight book charades as well as designing their own crayons.
