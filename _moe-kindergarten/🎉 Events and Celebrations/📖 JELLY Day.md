<p>At MK @ West Spring, we celebrate Children's Day in conjunction with our
Literacy Day- which we call JELLY Day (<strong>J</strong>ust <strong>E</strong>njoy
the <strong>L</strong>anguage and <strong>L</strong>iteracy around <strong>Y</strong>ou)!</p>
<h2>3 October 2024</h2>
<p>To celebrate Childrenâ€™s Day and J.E.L.L.Y. Day, the children came to school
in creative costumes, bringing their favorite books. Alongside the festivities,
there were fun activities for the children, such as Germ Tag, a game related
to one of the Big Books the children chose as their favourite Starlight
book. They shared many wonderful stories with their peers. For snack, the
children enjoyed rainbow cakes and popcorn while watching some short movies
together as a class. We are so proud of our children for embracing their
imaginations and sharing special moments together!</p>
