<h3>Hari Raya Celebration 2025</h3>
<p>On 4 April 2025, our children celebrated Hari Raya with a meaningful and
joyful experience. They enjoyed a traditional <em>kenduri</em> (communal
meal) with peers, sharing festive snacks like dates, Semperit Milo cookies,
and banana chips while practising values such as respect and turn-taking.</p>
<p>Children also took part in cultural activities like the bamboo dance and
sarong games, fostering teamwork, communication, and inclusiveness. The
celebration ended with heartfelt Hari Raya cards exchanged among friends,
wrapped in money packets, as children learned respectful greetings and
gestures.</p>
<p><em>Selamat Hari Raya!</em> 🌙🕌</p>

<h3>Hari Raya Celebration 2024</h3>
<p>Hari Raya, also known as Eid, is a significant celebration for Muslims
around the world, including those of Malay, Arab, Chinese, Indian and other
ethnicities. It’s a time for family, community and charitable acts, and
it’s wonderful to see how people of diverse backgrounds come together to
mark this important occasion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During our school celebration on 12th April 2024, we took a step to dispel
the common misconception that Hari Raya is solely celebrated by the Malay
community. We invited both children and a colleague from diverse ethnic
backgrounds to share their personal experiences of celebrating Hari Raya,
thereby illuminating the richness and inclusivity of this festive occasion.</p>
<p>To provide the children with an authentic experience, the children participated
in a communal meal with their peers, as they were introduced to some traditional
Hari Raya snacks such as, Banana Chips, and Rainbow cookies and pre-cut
dates. Our collaborative spirit extended beyond the school walls as families
were invited to participate in an act of kindness by donating their used
Hari Raya clothes. Through this gesture, we fostered a sense of community
and compassion, teaching our little ones the value of sharing and caring.
In doing so we have not only celebrated Hari Raya but also nurtured understanding,
respect, and unity among our children. 🌙🕌🌈</p>
