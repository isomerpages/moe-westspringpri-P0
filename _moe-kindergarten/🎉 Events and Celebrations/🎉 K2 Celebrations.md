<h4>K2 Celebrates 2024</h4>
<p>On 1st November 2024, MK@West Spring hosted its <em>K2 Celebrates!</em> event
for our K2 classes. This special day provided families with a meaningful
opportunity to bond with their children and create lasting memories. The
children proudly took to the stage, performing with their classmates and
sharing their joy. Together with their families, our K2 children also sealed
a Time Capsule that will be opened in 2030, marking a memorable milestone
in their kindergarten journey!
