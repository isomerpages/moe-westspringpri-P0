<h4>K2 Celebrates 2025🎉</h4>
<p>On 11th November 2025, MK @ West Spring held its <strong>K2 Celebrates!</strong> event
for our graduating K2 classes. It was a heartwarming occasion that brought
back wonderful memories of the children’s time in kindergarten for both
parents and teachers. We reflected on their growth, milestones, and joyful
learning experiences, and celebrated how far they have come. As they prepare
for their next chapter, we honour their achievements and encourage them
to continue dreaming big and reaching new heights. 🚀</p>

<h4><br><br>K2 Celebrates 2024</h4>
<p>On 1st November 2024, MK@West Spring hosted its <em>K2 Celebrates!</em> event

children proudly took to the stage, performing with their classmates and
sharing their joy. Together with their families, our K2 children also sealed
a Time Capsule that will be opened in 2030, marking a memorable milestone
in their kindergarten journey!
