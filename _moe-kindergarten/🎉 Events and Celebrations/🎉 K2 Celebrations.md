On the 10th of November 2023, we celebrated the milestone of our K2 children as they completed their 2 years journey with us in MK @ West Spring.  
  
It was a day of showcasing their accomplishments through different platforms!

*   The children had the opportunity to perform on stage with their classmates with pride and enjoyment!
    
*   Along with their family members, our K2 children were engaged in various carnival activities that were prepared by the children and teachers.&nbsp;
    
*   Our K2 teachers have set up exhibition booths which showcased the K2-P1 Transition Programme as well as their WoW (Weeks of Wonder) Project learning about our neighbourhood, Bukit Panjang. Letâ€™s dive into the photo reel as we celebrate this joyous occasion!
