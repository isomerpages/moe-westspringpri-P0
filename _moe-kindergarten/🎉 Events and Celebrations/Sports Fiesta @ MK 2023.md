On 5th July 2023, our MK children and parents participated actively in the annual Sports Fiesta.

This event aimed to strengthen family bonding, as well as to reinforce the notion of perseverance and sportsmanship among other values. The obstacle courses were intentionally set up to reinforce certain motor skills that the children had learnt in the MK curriculum, and provided them the platform to put them into practice. Parents were also invited to join in the relay race and get active with their child. Upon completing the relay, each MK child was rewarded with a Finisher's medal for persevering to the end.

It is heartening to see the sportsmanship and support throughout the event, as teachers, children and even parents joined in the cheers to spur one another on!
