<h1>Discover West Spring 2023 (K2 Transition to Primary 1)</h1>
<p>At MOE Kindergarten, we believe that parents play a crucial role in their
child's education and we want to partner with you to ensure your child's
success.</p>
<p>On 19 May 2023, we partnered West Spring Primary School to invite our
K2 parents as well as the public for a K2 Transition Talk. It provided
an invaluable opportunity for families, prospective students, and our school
community to come together and connect. In addition to sharing information
about our how MK supports the children to ensure a smooth transition to
primary school, it was also an opportunity for parents to meet our dedicated
staff, tour our classrooms and facilities and learn about West Spring Primary's
innovative programmes and curriculum.&nbsp;We extend our gratitude to all
who attended and contributed to the success of this event!</p>
