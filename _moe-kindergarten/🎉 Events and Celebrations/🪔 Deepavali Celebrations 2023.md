Deepavali, the Festival of Lights, was commemorated in conjunction with our Year-End Celebration on 15 November 2023. To wrap up the end of the school year, the children had the opportunity to learn about and experience Indian culture through various activities planned.

With the help of some Parent Volunteers, interactive booths were set up for the children to explore Henna drawing, Indian traditional musical instruments, accessories, spices and rangoli art. Children also got to taste some Indian snacks like papadam and murukku during the mini movie screening segment too!
