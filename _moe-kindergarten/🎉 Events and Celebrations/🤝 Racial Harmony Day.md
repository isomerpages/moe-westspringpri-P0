<h4>Racial Harmony Day 2025</h4>
<p>On 21 July 2025, MK@West Spring celebrated Racial Harmony Day with a range
of fun, meaningful, and engaging activities designed to help our children
learn more about the significance of this important day in Singapore. As
part of the celebration, we also introduced a family-based activity in
the form of the ‚ÄúRacial Harmony Day Bingo‚Äù. This interactive bingo game
encourages children to explore and appreciate their own cultural heritage,
as well as learn about the traditions of others. It also provides a wonderful
opportunity for family bonding through shared learning and thoughtful conversations.</p>

<h4>Racial Harmony Day 2024</h4>
<p>Racial Harmony Day is an annual celebration in Singapore, as we celebrate
the uniqueness of different cultures and races. Values like Respect and
Care were emphasized to the children on this special day too, as they learnt
to show respect and care towards people of different races.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During our RHD celebration this year on 19th July, the children were introduced
to the different races, cultures and food. We also learnt more about friends
from interracial families. Apart from deepening their understanding of
the different races, cultures and traditions, the children were also engaged
in classroom activities that tied in with the theme of this year's National
Day motto- ‚ÄúTogether as One‚Äù.</p>
<p>MK children, and MK and KCare staff came together on this special day
to decorate and piece up the craftwork into a collage, as we celebrated
our diversity and uniqueness in a multicultural society, together as One.</p>
