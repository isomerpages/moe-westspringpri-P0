<h2>First Day of School 2025</h2>
<p>The first day of K1 at MK @ West Spring was a memorable milestone for
both parents and children, filled with excitement, joy, and anticipation.
Our classrooms came alive with laughter as the children met their new friends
and teachers. We are delighted to begin this journey with the little ones
and eagerly look forward to a year of growth, exploration, and learning!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>First Day of School 2024</h2>
<p>The first day of school marks a special milestone, brimming with anticipation
and new beginnings. We're here to support you and your child every step
of the way. Our team of dedicated MK educators are committed to providing
a nurturing environment for your child to learn, grow, and thrive.</p>
<p>During orientation, the children and their parents met our friendly teachers,
explored the classroom, and learned about our routines. Activities like
snack time and icebreaker games helped children settle in and build connections
with peers. They also met their Mother Tongue Language teachers and embraced
their cultural heritage through engaging storytelling sessions.</p>
<p>We're excited to witness your child's growth and achievements this year.
Thank you for trusting us with their education. Let's work in partnership
to ensure that our children are "On To A Strong Start!"</p>
