<p>The first day of school marks a special milestone, brimming with anticipation
and new beginnings. We're here to support you and your child every step
of the way. Our team of dedicated MK educators are committed to providing
a nurturing environment for your child to learn, grow, and thrive.</p>
<p>During orientation, the children and their parents met our friendly teachers,
explored the classroom, and learned about our routines. Activities like
snack time and icebreaker games helped children settle in and build connections
with peers. They also met their Mother Tongue Language teachers and embraced
their cultural heritage through engaging storytelling sessions.</p>
<p>We're excited to witness your child's growth and achievements this year.
Thank you for trusting us with their education. Let's work in partnership
to ensure that our children are "On To A Strong Start!"</p>

<p>Welcome back to a new school year!</p>
<p>It was so wonderful to see the smiling faces of our K1 children for the
first time, as they embark on their kindergarten journey with MK @ West
Spring.</p>
<p>As part of the K1 Orientation, parents were invited to enter the school
with their child as they experienced various ice-breaker activities.</p>
