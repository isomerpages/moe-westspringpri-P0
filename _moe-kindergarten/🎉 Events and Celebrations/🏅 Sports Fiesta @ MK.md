<h4>Sports Fiesta 2025</h4>
<p>This year, the MK’s Sports Fiesta was held in conjunction with Parents
Appreciation Day, bringing our K1 and K2 families together for an afternoon
of active fun and bonding. With the theme of <em>Zoolympics!</em>, this
year’s event was held in a lively carnival-style format,&nbsp; aimed to
foster stronger parent-child relationships while promoting the core values
of perseverance and sportsmanship.</p>
<p>Children and parents worked hand-in-hand to complete animal-themed station
games, many of which reinforced key motor skills taught in our MK curriculum.
With cheers, laughter, and plenty of teamwork, <em>Zoolympics!</em> was a
joyful celebration of movement, learning, and family connection.</p>

<h4>Sports Fiesta 2024</h4>
<p>“Sports Fiesta 2024” aims to strengthen parent-child relationship, as
well as to reinforce the values of perseverance and sportsmanship.</p>
<p>This is the first year we are running the Sports Fiesta based on previous
years’ feedback from parents, where they wished they could be more involved
in the event, this year’s iteration was done in a carnival format, as we
hosted a combined session for our K1 and K2 classes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stations are intentionally set up to reinforce motor skills that the
children have learnt in our MK curriculum, and provided them with the platform
to put them into practice. The Sports Fiesta was well-received by the parents
and children!</p>

<h4>Sports Fiesta 2023</h4>
<p>On 5th July 2023, our MK children and parents participated actively in
the annual Sports Fiesta.</p>
<p>This event aimed to strengthen family bonding, as well as to reinforce
the notion of perseverance and sportsmanship among other values. The obstacle
courses were intentionally set up to reinforce certain motor skills that
the children had learnt in the MK curriculum, and provided them the platform
to put them into practice. Parents were also invited to join in the relay
race and get active with their child. Upon completing the relay, each MK
child was rewarded with a Finisher's medal for persevering to the end.</p>
<p>It is heartening to see the sportsmanship and support throughout the event,
as teachers, children and even parents joined in the cheers to spur one
another on!</p>
