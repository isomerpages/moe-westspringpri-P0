<h4>Sports Fiesta 2024</h4>
<p>“Sports Fiesta 2024” aims to strengthen parent-child relationship, as
well as to reinforce the values of perseverance and sportsmanship.</p>
<p>This is the first year we are running the Sports Fiesta as a” with “Based
on previous years’ feedback from parents, where they wished they could
be more involved in the event, this year’s iteration was done in a carnival
format, as we hosted a combined session for our K1 and K2 classes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stations are intentionally set up to reinforce motor skills that the
children have learnt in our MK curriculum, and provided them with the platform
to put them into practice. The Sports Fiesta was well-received by the parents
and children!</p>

<h4>Sports Fiesta 2023</h4>
<p>On 5th July 2023, our MK children and parents participated actively in
the annual Sports Fiesta.</p>
<p>This event aimed to strengthen family bonding, as well as to reinforce
the notion of perseverance and sportsmanship among other values. The obstacle
courses were intentionally set up to reinforce certain motor skills that
the children had learnt in the MK curriculum, and provided them the platform
to put them into practice. Parents were also invited to join in the relay
race and get active with their child. Upon completing the relay, each MK
child was rewarded with a Finisher's medal for persevering to the end.</p>
<p>It is heartening to see the sportsmanship and support throughout the event,
as teachers, children and even parents joined in the cheers to spur one
another on!</p>
