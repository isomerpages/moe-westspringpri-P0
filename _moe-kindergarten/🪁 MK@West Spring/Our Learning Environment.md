<h2>Every space a learning space</h2>
<p>MK’s learning environment is designed with the child in mind. Our creative
use of available space encourages children to discover and explore their
surroundings. Safe outdoor spaces promote learning, engagement and active
play while inviting and thoughtfully-designed classrooms support teaching
and learning.</p>
