<h1>Senja Neighbourhood Walk</h1>
<p>Our K1 children have been learning about people and places in their surroundings
as part of the Term 2 HI-Light curriculum. To deepen this learning, the
children went on a neighbourhood walk around Senja on 13 and 14 May 2024.
During the walk, we visited a hawker centre and observed the various shops
and services along the way. We also noted how the tray return system at
Senja Hawker Centre helps lighten the cleaners' workload.</p>

<h1>The Arena @ Keat Hong</h1>
<p>On the 1st and 2nd November 2023, the K1 children embarked on their final
Field Trip for the year. They visited The Arena @ Keat Hong to explore
the features of an inclusive playground and the variety of play equipment
available. Besides discovering how the equipment were specially designed
and built for children with different needs to play at, the Field Trip
allowed the children to better understand the needs of others who may be
different from them.</p>

<h1>Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay</h1>
<p>On week 8 of Term 3, the K1 children went on a field trip to Gardens By
The Bay and explored the Flower Dome to learn more about edible plants.
They were introduced to the different parts of a plant that can be eaten
and viewed plants that provide us with food such as olives, oranges and
limes. In addition, the children also had hands-on opportunities to use
their sense of touch and smell to explore plants such as rosemary, thyme,
mint, curry leaves and pandan leaves. Finally, they visited the Orchid
Extravaganza exhibition which displayed different types of orchids from
Southeast Asia. The children got to see Singapore‚Äôs National Flower, Papilionanthe
Miss Joaquim (formerly known as Vanda Miss Joaquim) which they learnt about
in a previous HI-Light activity.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Neighbourhood Walk</h1>

relationships with the people around them. On week 8 of Term 2, we went
on our first field trip, a Neighbourhood Walk, to observe and make new
discoveries about the people, places and features in their neighbourhood!
