<h4>Singapore Zoo (MTL) 2025</h4>
<p>In Term 3, children are learning about animals and plants in our natural
environment during their respective Mother Tongue Language (MTL) lessons.
To extend their learning, our MTL teachers have planned for a field trip
to the Singapore Zoo, where children will learn more about the different
types of wildlife, their habitats and ways to protect these animals.</p>
<p>The Malay Language classes embarked on a programme called <em>Kembara Nusantara</em>.
Firstly, they went to Fragile Forest to look for <em>Sang Kancil</em> (Mousedeer),
a significant animal in the Malay folktales and community. They then went
to visit the <em>Orangutan</em>, who are critically endangered and learned
ways to protect them.</p>
<p>The Chinese Language classes enjoyed watching otters and compared monkeys
with orangutans. The children also played a fun matching game, identifying
zebras, rhinos, giraffes and pelicans by their special body features. They
were especially fascinated to discover how giraffes sleep and eat.</p>
<p>The Tamil Language classes focused on monkeys and elephants. They started
off with visiting the elephants and observed the food they ate. They then
saw a few different types of monkeys and the places they live in and food
they eat.</p>

<h4>Senja Neighbourhood Walk 2025</h4>
<p>As part of their exploration of people and places in the community, our
K1 children went on a lively neighbourhood walk around Senja! Along the
way, they observed familiar places like the hawker centre and nearby shops,
learning how each plays a part in our daily lives.</p>
<p>To show their appreciation, the children also presented handmade thank-you
cards to community helpers such as the bakers and cleaners—a meaningful
way to connect with and give back to the people who serve our neighbourhood
every day!

<h4>Inclusive Playground 2024</h4>
<p>Our Kindergarten 1 children visited an inclusive playground in Canberra
Park, where they had the opportunity to explore, learn, and engage with
a variety of play equipment designed to be accessible for children of all
abilities.</p>
<p>During the trip, the children actively observed and explored how people
with mobility challenges play in such an inclusive space. They asked thoughtful
questions about the equipment and safety features, deepening their understanding
of how inclusive playgrounds support diverse needs.</p>
<p>The children also practiced important safety practices during the field
trip, demonstrating appropriate behaviour and cooperation throughout the
day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This hands-on experience not only helped the children develop an appreciation
for inclusivity but also encouraged them to think critically about safety
and how different children can&nbsp; play together. It was a wonderful
opportunity for them to engage with the world in a meaningful way and share
their reflections in creative ways!

<h4>Woodlands Integrated Bus Interchange (MTL) 2024</h4>
<p>In Term 3, our K1 children have been exploring the themes of Transportation,
Safety, and Colours during their Mother Tongue Language (MTL) lessons.
To extend their learning, they went on an MTL field trip to the Woodlands
Integrated Transport Hub, where they further explored these topics. The
children also had the opportunity to practise their speaking skills by
conversing in their respective Mother Tongue languages with teachers and
peers.</p>

<h4>Singapore Zoo 2024</h4>
<p>On August 14 and 16, the children embarked on an exciting adventure to
the Fragile Forest at Singapore Zoo. They explored the layers of a rainforest,
discovering the unique features of each stratum. The highlight was getting
up close with various animals, where they marvelled at playful lemurs,
observed the slow movements of sloths, listened to the calls of whistling
ducks, and watched bats flutter overhead. The vibrant blue-crowned pigeons
added a splash of colour to their experience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The children also visited KidzWorld and Little Paws, where they learned
about different pets and interacted with friendly animals. This hands-on
experience deepened their understanding of pet care, complementing their
HI-Light curriculum.</p>

<h4>Senja Neighbourhood Walk 2024</h4>
<p>Our K1 children have been learning about people and places in their surroundings
as part of the Term 2 HI-Light curriculum. To deepen this learning, the
children went on a neighbourhood walk around Senja on 13 and 14 May 2024.
During the walk, we visited a hawker centre and observed the various shops
and services along the way. We also noted how the tray return system at
Senja Hawker Centre helps lighten the cleaners' workload.</p>

<h4>The Arena @ Keat Hong 2023</h4>
<p>On the 1st and 2nd November 2023, the K1 children embarked on their final
Field Trip for the year. They visited The Arena @ Keat Hong to explore
the features of an inclusive playground and the variety of play equipment
available. Besides discovering how the equipment were specially designed
and built for children with different needs to play at, the Field Trip
allowed the children to better understand the needs of others who may be
different from them.</p>

<h4>Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay 2023</h4>
<p>On week 8 of Term 3, the K1 children went on a field trip to Gardens By
The Bay and explored the Flower Dome to learn more about edible plants.
They were introduced to the different parts of a plant that can be eaten
and viewed plants that provide us with food such as olives, oranges and
limes. In addition, the children also had hands-on opportunities to use
their sense of touch and smell to explore plants such as rosemary, thyme,
mint, curry leaves and pandan leaves. Finally, they visited the Orchid
Extravaganza exhibition which displayed different types of orchids from
Southeast Asia. The children got to see Singapore’s National Flower, Papilionanthe
Miss Joaquim (formerly known as Vanda Miss Joaquim) which they learnt about
in a previous HI-Light activity.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Neighbourhood Walk 2023</h4>
<p>As we explored the topic on “My Neighbourhood”, we learnt about the people
and places in the neighbourhood and the importance of building positive
relationships with the people around them. On week 8 of Term 2, we went
on our first field trip, a Neighbourhood Walk, to observe and make new
discoveries about the people, places and features in their neighbourhood!
Let’s check out on our adventure!</p>

<h4>Police Visit 2023</h4>
<p>On 18 May 2023, the children were visited by the police. This Learning
Journey was arranged to extend their learning on the topic of "My Neighbourhood".</p>
<p>The policemen shared with the children about stranger danger, and also
brought along some police equipment and a police car for the children to
explore. The children were very excited by this visit. Share in their excitement
by checking out the photo gallery below!</p>
