# The Arena @ Keat Hong

On the 1st and 2nd November 2023, the K1 children embarked on their final Field Trip for the year. They visited The Arena @ Keat Hong to explore the features of an inclusive playground and the variety of play equipment available. Besides discovering how the equipment were specially designed and built for children with different needs to play at, the Field Trip allowed the children to better understand the needs of others who may be different from them.

Let‚Äôs take a look at their learning journey in the photo reel below!

# Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay

On week 8 of Term 3, the K1 children went on a field trip to Gardens By The Bay and explored the Flower Dome to learn more about edible plants. They were introduced to the different parts of a plant that can be eaten and viewed plants that provide us with food such as olives, oranges and limes. In addition, the children also had hands-on opportunities to use their sense of touch and smell to explore plants such as rosemary, thyme, mint, curry leaves and pandan leaves. Finally, they visited the Orchid Extravaganza exhibition which displayed different types of orchids from Southeast Asia. The children got to see Singapore‚Äôs National Flower, Papilionanthe Miss Joaquim (formerly known as Vanda Miss Joaquim) which they learnt about in a previous HI-Light activity.&nbsp;

# Neighbourhood Walk
As we explored the topic on ‚ÄúMy Neighbourhood‚Äù, we learnt about the people and places in the neighbourhood and the importance of building positive relationships with the people around them. On week 8 of Term 2, we went on our first field trip, a Neighbourhood Walk, to observe and make new discoveries about the people, places and features in their neighbourhood! Let‚Äôs check out on our adventure!

# Police Visit
On 18 May 2023, the children were visited by the police. This Learning Journey was arranged to extend their learning on the topic of "My Neighbourhood". 

The policemen shared with the children about stranger danger, and also brought along some police equipment and a police car for the children to explore. The children were very excited by this visit. Share in their excitement by checking out the photo gallery below!
