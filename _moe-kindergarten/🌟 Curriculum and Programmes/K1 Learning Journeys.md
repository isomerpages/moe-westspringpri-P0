<h1>2024 Woodlands Integrated Bus Interchange (MTL field trip)</h1>
<p>In Term 3, our K1 children have been exploring the themes of Transportation,
Safety, and Colours during their Mother Tongue Language (MTL) lessons.
To extend their learning, they went on an MTL field trip to the Woodlands
Integrated Transport Hub, where they further explored these topics. The
children also had the opportunity to practise their speaking skills by
conversing in their respective Mother Tongue languages with teachers and
peers.</p>

<h1>2024 Singapore Zoo</h1>
<p>On August 14 and 16, the children embarked on an exciting adventure to
the Fragile Forest at Singapore Zoo. They explored the layers of a rainforest,
discovering the unique features of each stratum. The highlight was getting
up close with various animals, where they marvelled at playful lemurs,
observed the slow movements of sloths, listened to the calls of whistling
ducks, and watched bats flutter overhead. The vibrant blue-crowned pigeons
added a splash of colour to their experience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The children also visited KidzWorld and Little Paws, where they learned
about different pets and interacted with friendly animals. This hands-on
experience deepened their understanding of pet care, complementing their
HI-Light curriculum.</p>

<h1>2024 Senja Neighbourhood Walk</h1>
<p>Our K1 children have been learning about people and places in their surroundings
as part of the Term 2 HI-Light curriculum. To deepen this learning, the
children went on a neighbourhood walk around Senja on 13 and 14 May 2024.
During the walk, we visited a hawker centre and observed the various shops
and services along the way. We also noted how the tray return system at
Senja Hawker Centre helps lighten the cleaners' workload.</p>

<h1>The Arena @ Keat Hong</h1>
<p>On the 1st and 2nd November 2023, the K1 children embarked on their final
Field Trip for the year. They visited The Arena @ Keat Hong to explore
the features of an inclusive playground and the variety of play equipment
available. Besides discovering how the equipment were specially designed
and built for children with different needs to play at, the Field Trip
allowed the children to better understand the needs of others who may be
different from them.</p>

<h1>Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay</h1>
<p>On week 8 of Term 3, the K1 children went on a field trip to Gardens By
The Bay and explored the Flower Dome to learn more about edible plants.
They were introduced to the different parts of a plant that can be eaten
and viewed plants that provide us with food such as olives, oranges and
limes. In addition, the children also had hands-on opportunities to use
their sense of touch and smell to explore plants such as rosemary, thyme,
mint, curry leaves and pandan leaves. Finally, they visited the Orchid
Extravaganza exhibition which displayed different types of orchids from
Southeast Asia. The children got to see Singapore‚Äôs National Flower, Papilionanthe
Miss Joaquim (formerly known as Vanda Miss Joaquim) which they learnt about
in a previous HI-Light activity.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Neighbourhood Walk</h1>
<p>As we explored the topic on ‚ÄúMy Neighbourhood‚Äù, we learnt about the people

relationships with the people around them. On week 8 of Term 2, we went
on our first field trip, a Neighbourhood Walk, to observe and make new
discoveries about the people, places and features in their neighbourhood!
