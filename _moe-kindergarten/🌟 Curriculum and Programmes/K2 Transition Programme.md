<h4>2025</h4>
<p>In Term 4, our K2 children took part in a structured transition programme
to support their move to primary school. Through activities such as visiting
the school canteen, exploring the primary school grounds, interviewing
a primary school teacher, and experiencing a lower primary lesson, the
children became more familiar with their new environment and gained a clearer
understanding of primary school life.</p>
<p>To further support them, the Befriend Project paired our K2 children with
Primary 3 students, giving them the opportunity to build friendships and
feel supported. Having familiar faces to turn to helped ease their anxieties,
building confidence and reassurance as they prepare for their transition
to Primary 1.</p>

<h4>2024</h4>
<p>In Term 4, our K2 children embarked on a comprehensive transition programme
to ease their transition to primary school. This programme included a variety
of activities designed to familiarise them with their new environment and
alleviate any anxieties.</p>
<p>The children had the opportunity to visit the school canteen and explore
the primary school grounds. They also interviewed a primary school teacher
to gain insights into primary school life and experienced a lower primary
lesson firsthand.</p>
<p>To foster a sense of belonging and support, we implemented the Befriend
Project. Primary 3 students paired up with our K2 children, spending time
together to build relationships. This initiative ensured that the K2s had
familiar faces to turn to for help and guidance in their first year of
primary school.</p>
<p>These experiences collectively helped to calm the children's nerves and
dispel any doubts they may have had about their upcoming transition to
primary 1.</p>
