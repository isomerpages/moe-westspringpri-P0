At MK @ West Spring, we believe that fostering good and right values in our children is essential for their growth and development.

Every term, we introduce one value through a school-wide assembly. Children learn about the value, along with its unique mascot and song, each thoughtfully created to reflect that specific value.

The value will be reinforced in both English and Mother Tongue Language lessons through engaging activities and storytelling, along with visual displays placed in common areas throughout the school.

We hope that with these experiences, MK@WS will be able to :

*   Establish a positive culture
*   Build strong relationships
*   Role-model positive behavior
*   Collaborate with families
