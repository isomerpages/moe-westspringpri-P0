# K2 MTL WoW Projects Field Trip

In the last 2 weeks of Term 3, the K2 children embarked on their very first Mother Tongue Language (MTL) field trip. These field trips were purposefully planned based on the childrenâ€™s topics of interest for their WoW Projects. Across the three languages, we have decided to find out more about our neighbourhood, Bukit Panjang! The children discovered many hidden gems and learnt new things through this meaningful activity.

We invite you to take a look at the different photo reels to find out more about the different places our children visited!

# Collaborative, self-directed learning
![](/images/wonder.png)
Each term at MOE Kindergarten (MK) culminates in a **Weeks of Wonder (WoW) project**. In a year, children complete 2 WoW projects in English and another 2 in their Mother Tongue Language (MTL). Children will work together with their friends on a topic of their choice.

Through WoW projects, children learn how to:

*   Make their own decisions.
*   Develop problem-solving, process and investigative skills.
*   Collaborate with one another.
*   Communicate effectively in English and their MTL.

Through the process of finding answers to their own questions, WoW projects allow children to:

*   Experience the joy of self-motivated learning.
*   Build their confidence.
*   Strengthen their learning dispositions or positive behaviours and attitudes towards learning.
