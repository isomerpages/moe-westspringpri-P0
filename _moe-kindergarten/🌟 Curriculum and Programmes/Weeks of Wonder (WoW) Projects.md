# Collaborative, self-directed learning
![](/images/wonder.png)
Each term at MOE Kindergarten (MK) culminates in a **Weeks of Wonder (WoW) project**. In a year, children complete 2 WoW projects in English and another 2 in their Mother Tongue Language (MTL). Children will work together with their friends on a topic of their choice.

Through WoW projects, children learn how to:

*   Make their own decisions.
*   Develop problem-solving, process and investigative skills.
*   Collaborate with one another.
*   Communicate effectively in English and their MTL.

Through the process of finding answers to their own questions, WoW projects allow children to:

*   Experience the joy of self-motivated learning.
*   Build their confidence.
*   Strengthen their learning dispositions or positive behaviours and attitudes towards learning.
