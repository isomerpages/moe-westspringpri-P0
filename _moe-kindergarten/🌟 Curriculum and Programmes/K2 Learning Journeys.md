# K2 MTL Field Trips (WoW Project)

In the last 2 weeks of Term 3, the K2 children embarked on their very first Mother Tongue Language (MTL) field trip. These field trips were purposefully planned based on the childrenâ€™s topics of interest for their WoW Projects. Across the three languages, we have decided to find out more about our neighbourhood, Bukit Panjang! The children discovered many hidden gems and learnt new things through this meaningful activity.

We invite you to take a look at the different photo reels to find out more about the different places our children visited!

# Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve

On 25 July 2023, the K2 children embarked on an exciting adventure to Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve.&nbsp;

This field trip aimed to extend their learning on Term 3â€™s topic: Animals and Plants in Our Natural Environment.&nbsp;

Although the weather was hot and humid, it did not dampen the childrenâ€™s high spirits. They thoroughly enjoyed themselves exploring Singaporeâ€™s wetlands environment&nbsp; and bonding with their friends over their shared experience.

Look below for a photo reel of the childrenâ€™s exciting day!

# Nam Hwa Opera
On the 8th and 9th May 2023, our K2 children visited the Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre for an opera workshop. The Nam Hwa Opera has kindly allowed our children to experience firsthand regarding the basics of Teochew Opera.

The children were engaged in multiple fun activities that were being thoughtfully planned out and aligned with the K2 curriculum as an extension. They had a meaningful session with the vendors. Let's dive in the photo gallery to find out more about what our K2 children have learnt!
