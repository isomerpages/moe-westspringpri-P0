<h1>2024 Young Intertidal Explorer Skit</h1>
<p>In Term 3, the children have been learning about marine life and how to
conserve the environment. We engaged Young Nautilus to conduct an indoor
workshop, <em>Young Intertidal Explorer Skit</em>, where children experienced
hands-on learning to deepen their understanding on the topic.</p>
<p>The workshop included a skit, a discussion, and a marine touch tank, where
the children interacted with live marine animals such as sea stars, sea
urchins, sea snails, and hermit crabs.</p>
<p>Through this workshop, the children developed greater awareness of the
need to show responsibility, care, and respect for the environment, while
learning how human actions impact the world around them. It was a fun and
meaningful experience for all!</p>

<h1>2024 River Wonders (MTL field trip)</h1>
<p>In Term 3, our K2 children have been exploring the theme of Animals and
Plants in Our Natural Environment during their Mother Tongue Language (MTL)
lessons.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To extend their learning about sea creatures, the K2 children went on
an MTL immersion trip to River Wonders, where they discovered more about
manatees, different types of fish, otters, and their unique habitats. Throughout
the trip, the children practised conversing in their respective MTLs with
their teachers.</p>

<h1>2024 National Gallery</h1>
<p>In Term 2, as part of their learning about places in Singapore, the Kindergarten
2 children went on a field trip to the National Gallery Singapore. During
the guided tour, they were introduced to two artworks and discussed the
elements of art in each piece. The tour also reinforced family values such
as love, care, commitment, and respect.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, the children explored various learning spaces at the Keppel
Centre for Art Education (KCAE), where they enjoyed hands-on learning experiences.
It was an enriching and eventful learning journey for the children!</p>

<h1>K2 MTL Field Trips (WoW Project)</h1>
<p>In the last 2 weeks of Term 3, the K2 children embarked on their very
first Mother Tongue Language (MTL) field trip. These field trips were purposefully
planned based on the childrenâ€™s topics of interest for their WoW Projects.
Across the three languages, we have decided to find out more about our
neighbourhood, Bukit Panjang! The children discovered many hidden gems
and learnt new things through this meaningful activity.</p>
<p>We invite you to take a look at the different photo reels to find out
more about the different places our children visited!</p>

<h1>Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve</h1>
<p>On 25 July 2023, the K2 children embarked on an exciting adventure to
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This field trip aimed to extend their learning on Term 3â€™s topic: Animals
and Plants in Our Natural Environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the weather was hot and humid, it did not dampen the childrenâ€™s
high spirits. They thoroughly enjoyed themselves exploring Singaporeâ€™s
wetlands environment&nbsp; and bonding with their friends over their shared
experience.</p>

<h1>Nam Hwa Opera</h1>
<p>On the 8th and 9th May 2023, our K2 children visited the Singapore Chinese
Cultural Centre for an opera workshop. The Nam Hwa Opera has kindly allowed
our children to experience firsthand regarding the basics of Teochew Opera.</p>
<p>The children were engaged in multiple fun activities that were being thoughtfully
planned out and aligned with the K2 curriculum as an extension. They had
a meaningful session with the vendors. Let's dive in the photo gallery
