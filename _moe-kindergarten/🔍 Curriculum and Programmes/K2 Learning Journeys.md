# Nam Hwa Opera
On the 8th and 9th May 2023, our K2 children visited the Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre for an opera workshop. The Nam Hwa Opera has kindly allowed our children to experience firsthand regarding the basics of Teochew Opera.

The children were engaged in multiple fun activities that were being thoughtfully planned out and aligned with the K2 curriculum as an extension. They had a meaningful session with the vendors. Let's dive in the photo gallery to find out more about what our K2 children have learnt!
