At West Spring Primary, our SHINE Aspirations serve as a guiding light to prepare our students to be future-ready. These aspirations, which stand for Show Care for Self and Others, Harness Communication and Connection, Ignite Creative and Critical Thinking, and Nurture Passion and Empower Confidence. Students, staff, and parents have embarked on an inspiring journey to explore what each aspiration means to them. Together, they have woven a tapestry of thoughts and feelings using yarn that shape their unique journeys. Together, we aim to inspire all with our SHINE aspirations, nurturing a community of individuals who shine bright, confident, and ready to tackle the challenges of the future. Join us in this inspiring journey at West Spring Primary!
