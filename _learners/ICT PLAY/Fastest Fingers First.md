#### 2023
We recently held the Fastest Fingers First! challenge for different levels. The Primary 1 and Primary 2 students had their mini challenge within their form classes, while the students from Primary 3 to Primary 5 participated during recess. They enthusiastically challenged their peers and showcased their impressive typing skills, receiving cheers from their fellow classmates. It was an exhilarating experience for everyone involved.

Congratulations to all the winners!
