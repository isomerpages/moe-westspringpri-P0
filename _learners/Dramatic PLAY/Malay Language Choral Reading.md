Our students performed Choral Reading based on the theme ‘Joy of using the Malay language’. (Keceriaan dalam Berbahasa).&nbsp;

  

On 8th July 2023, our school was invited to the ‘Fiesta Bahasa 2023’ to receive an award at One Punggol. Our school won First Place in the Choral Reading Competition.&nbsp;
