#### 2023

As the term is coming to an end, let's look back at all the fun our students had at the Eureka Space since the start of this year!

The Eureka Space is an outdoor makerspace in the school where students can make use of their creativity as they embark on their maker projects during recess every Thursday and Friday. It is a platform for all students to explore their interests and passion in both physical and digital making.

With the help of our PSG, the students embarked on various maker projects like bead structures, satay stick bridges, and mini paper lanterns. Students also had the opportunity to explore coding games with iPads at the Eureka Space. New activities will be introduced every term, so keep a lookout for the activities after the June holidays!

For now, let's look at our students in action as well as their amazing creations from the first semester!
