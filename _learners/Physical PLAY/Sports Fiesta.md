This year's Sports Fiesta was held on April 27th. The school dedicated the entire day to this event, providing opportunities for the students to experience both classroom and physical activities related to Physical Education (PE). In addition to classroom activities, Primary 1 and Primary 2 students were tasked with completing an obstacle challenge course, and parents were invited to observe this memorable moment for our young ones. As for Primary 3 to Primary 6 students, they participated in a Sports Education Programme (SEP) designed to pique their interest in the various sports. They also competed against each other in inter-class games.
The event concluded with our West Spring Primary School (WSPS) Workout, held in conjunction with our 10th Anniversary. In addition, Form Teachers awarded medals to their students after they had accomplished the physical task objectives in their respective obstacle challenge courses and inter-class games. It was heartening to see all students enjoying themselves, cheering on their classmates, and demonstrating determination and resilience during the physical activities.
Congratulations to all West Springers for their positive and active participation. Please continue to stay physically active! Click on the photo album to gain insight into how the event went!
