#### **Rationale of West Spring Primary School Logo**

![](/images/School-Logo-1024x562.png)

Overall, the flow of turquoise hues throughout the logo carries with it the imagery of flowing spring water, and brings to life the Chinese idiom 饮水思源 (yǐnshuǐsīyuán), which literally means that we should remember the source as we take our drinks.

This spirit of remembering our origins and appreciating what we have is the hallmark of all students at West Spring Primary School. It is a spirit of gratitude that will always spring eternal even as students graduate and move on to scale higher peaks in life.
