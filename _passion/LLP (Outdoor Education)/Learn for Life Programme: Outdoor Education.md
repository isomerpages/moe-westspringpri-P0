Across their schooling years in West Spring Primary School, our students learn and grow actively through a myriad of Joyful ExperinC.E. (Experience Challenging Endeavours) in the outdoors. Our LLP focuses on using real-life outdoor experiential learning to develop West Springers who are confident and curious to explore the natural and urban outdoor environment, embrace and persevere through challenges and adventures with positive attitudes and competent in managing self, relationships with others and interacting with the environment. 

Ranging from learning about wildlife conservation in our local zoos, exploring Bukit Panjang’s neighbourhood parks and Singapore’s nature reserves to camping overnight with friends in the outdoors, West Springers enjoy varied outdoor learning experiences with their peers. Many discover and develop their interests and passion in the outdoors as they grow independently and collaboratively with their peers. As they spend more quality time with each other and the natural environment, it inculcates their stronger sense of stewardship for our environment, caring for the places that we live in and the community around them.
