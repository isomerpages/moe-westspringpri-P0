Understanding that outdoor learning pursuits can take many forms, our LLP aims to cater to studentsâ€™ varied interests and passion in the outdoors. Students can sign up for the different elective progammes of their interest. These elective programmes are offered on a termly basis as after-school programmes. 

Some students are keen to pursue outdoor adventure sports such as sport orienteering, rock climbing or kayaking while others may be more enthusiastic about nature exploration and conservation, taking interest in learning about the natural environment and devising solutions to sustain it. The artistically inclined may find joy in nature photography or nature journaling, spending time observing and capturing nature through their artistic lenses.
