West Springers start venturing into the outdoors once they begin their journey with us. Abundant green spaces in the school provide opportunities for students to learn in, through and about the outdoors. Teachers bring learning to life in the outdoors beyond the classrooms, enabling students to use their senses to explore the school environment safely, learn about the flora and fauna while inculcating their sense of responsibility to care for the school environment and its people.
