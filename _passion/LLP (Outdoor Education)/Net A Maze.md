Our school has our very own adventure playground! Elevated at a height above the parade square, our Net A-Maze adventure learning facility provides students with an exciting and challenging maze navigation experience. Safely bound by the nets, students explore moving through the maze independently or collaboratively with their peers. Programmes are designed progressively across the six years where students get to experience the Net A-Maze with different routes and challenges imbued in the differentiated activities.
