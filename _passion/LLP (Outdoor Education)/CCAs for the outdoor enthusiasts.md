From Primary 3 onwards, students who are more active, enthusiastic and passionate about outdoor learning and adventure can opt to join OE focused Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) such as Outdoor Adventure Club, Scouts and Environmental Science Club. These CCAs allows them more opportunities to be engaged further in outdoor experiential learning. Through these CCAs, we hope to guide our students to enhance their passion and develop holistically through the varied outdoor experiential activities.
