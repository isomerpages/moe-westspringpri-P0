**Primary 1 and 2 Programme for Active Learning (PAL) - OE**

Our lower primary students enjoy learning in the outdoors during our PAL - OE lessons across 2 years. PAL emphasises on joyful learning through active, hands-on experiences and developing students’ social emotional competencies such as managing their own emotions, learning to work together and respect one another's views. The PAL-OE lessons bring about lots of learning through fun as students explore the school environment, engage their 5 senses and think out of the box while learning to work together to investigate and complete learning tasks.&nbsp;

**Primary 1 and 2 Outdoor Learning Journeys to the Zoos**

The lower primary students begin their outdoor learning adventures in our local zoos such as Singapore Zoo and Jurong Bird Park annually. They undergo a series of executive functioning skills lessons with their Form Teachers prior to their outdoor trips to the zoos, ranging from conducting research on conserving the wildlife, planning the trip itinerary and learning to pack the essential items for the outdoor trip independently.&nbsp;

**Primary 3 One-Day Outdoor Exploration Experience**

In Primary 3, students are ready for greater rigour by spending a full day in the outdoors. They embark on a nature exploration walk in a local park, learning to identify the places that they are in using basic navigation skills, discovering Singapore’s rich flora and fauna all around them and experiencing communal team bonding activities with their peers and teachers.&nbsp;

**Primary 4 2D1N Outdoor Adventure Learning Camp**

Our Primary 4 students take a step out of the comfort of their homes by spending 2 days 1 night away from their family in an outdoor school-based camp. This marks their start to becoming more independent children, learning to rely on themselves by practising essential life skills such as washing their own cutlery and packing their clothes in the backpacks. The various outdoor learning activities such as navigating our school and neighbourhood, team-building games and communal meal times gave our students quality time in discovering their own strengths and weaknesses, working together to solve problems, overcome challenges and strengthen their class bonds.&nbsp;

**Primary 5 3D2N Outdoor Adventure Learning Camp**

By Primary 5, our students will be ready for a more rugged and adventurous experience through a 3 days 2 nights camp in an outdoor campsite, usually nested within nature. Adventure learning challenges such as outdoor cooking, low and high elements challenge courses, hiking in nature reserves and sleeping in tents or dormitories will nurture our students to becoming more confident, independent and resilient.&nbsp;
