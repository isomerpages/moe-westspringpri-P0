POP Fiesta 2023 on 3 November 2023 is the school’s inaugural event where we celebrate and showcase our West Springers’ self-initiated passion and interest. This was held in conjunction with our school’s tenth year anniversary celebrations.

The POP Fiesta (PM) was graced by Mr Edward Chia, MP for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, one of the many distinguished guests invited.

Here are some of the key highlights of the POP Fiesta:
