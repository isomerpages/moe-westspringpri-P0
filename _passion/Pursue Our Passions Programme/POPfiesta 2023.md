POP Fiesta 2023 on 3 November 2023 is the school’s inaugural event where we celebrate and showcase our West Springers’ self-initiated passion and interest. This was held in conjunction with our school’s tenth year anniversary celebrations.

The POP Fiesta (PM) was graced by Mr Edward Chia, MP for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, one of the many distinguished guests invited.

The two major segments of the event were: 
1. POP Discovery @ POPsquare: Participants got to explore the 37 passion networks booths set up by our enthusiastic students who shared about their passion journey. 
2. POPstars SHINE! @ Hall: The audiences were wowed by our inspiring POPstars' insightful sharing about their pursuit of passion.
