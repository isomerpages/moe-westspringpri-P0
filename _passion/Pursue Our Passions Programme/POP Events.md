**WSPS Speedcubing 2023**

Our first WSPS Speedcubing competition was held on March 28th. Each class was represented by two students - one girl and one boy. Although not many of the lower primary students were able to solve all six faces of the 3x3 Rubik's Cube, they were still courageous enough to represent their classes. On stage, the competitors were busy solving their Rubik's Cubes while their classmates cheered them on.

Congratulations to all the winners and participants for putting on such an incredible show! We hope that the students in West Spring will be inspired to learn how to solve the Rubik's Cube.
