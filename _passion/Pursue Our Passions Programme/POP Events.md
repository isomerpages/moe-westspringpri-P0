#### WSPS Reversi Tournament 2023

Over the course of two weeks, from the 11th to the 18th of April, West Springers from various classes took part in the first Reversi Tournament proudly organized by members of the Strategy Games Club CCA. This tournament was organized with the aim of promoting interest in strategy games.

It was a resounding success as many participants put on an impressive performance with their strategic gameplay and great sportsmanship. Congratulations to the winners and participants for making this a memorable experience for everyone involved!

We would also like to thank and affirm the members of the Club for rising to the challenge of sharing their passion for board games with the student community and for making this event possible. The club hopes that more students will get to appreciate the fun and benefits of playing games offered by the Strategy Games Club.

#### WSPS Speedcubing Competition 2023

Our first WSPS Speedcubing competition was held on March 28th. Each class was represented by two students - one girl and one boy. Although not many of the lower primary students were able to solve all six faces of the 3x3 Rubik's Cube, they were still courageous enough to represent their classes. On stage, the competitors were busy solving their Rubik's Cubes while their classmates cheered them on.

Congratulations to all the winners and participants for putting on such an incredible show! We hope that the students in West Spring will be inspired to learn how to solve the Rubik's Cube.
