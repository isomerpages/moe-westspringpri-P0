# POPfest 2022
On 15 November, our West Springers participated in "Pursue Our Passion" Festival 2022. P4 to P6 passion advocates were empowered to set up passion booths to share about their passions. It was truly an enriching time for our West Springers as they networked with one another over similar passions and they also had a chance to learn about the other passions shared by their friends.
